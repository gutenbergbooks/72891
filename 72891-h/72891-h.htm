</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Carter</span> looked up from her breakfast and
glanced anxiously at the clock.</p>

<p>“I wonder where that postman can be!” she exclaimed
fretfully. “He’s always late nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” retorted her husband, unfolding
his newspaper. “It’s because you want a letter
from William. The postman will be along all
right.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter sighed. She could not understand
the gap in her son’s correspondence. William was
her eldest and the pride of her heart. At twenty-seven
he had been a success in business. He had
dominated the family, advising his stout, deliberate
father, overwhelming his lame brother Daniel,
and bossing the two younger children, Leigh and
Emily, until, goaded to frenzy, first one and then
the other of the worms turned. As the only girl
in the family, Emily reached the limit of her endurance
long before Leigh came into the battle as
a feeble second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>But not even Emily could stem the tide of Mrs.
Carter’s devotion to her first-born. It had cost
her many a sleepless night when, more than a year
ago, William Henry Carter had been selected by a
well-known mercantile firm to go to Japan. It
had been a crowning opportunity for William; to
his mother it was a source of mingled pride and
anguish. She packed his trunk with unnumbered
socks and collar-buttons—she was sure he couldn’t
get them in Japan—and she smuggled in some jars
of strawberry jam, “the kind that dear Willie
always loved.”</p>

<p>Afterward her only solace had been his letters.
She overlooked his ungrateful wrath when the jam
jars broke into the socks, and fell back on her
pride in his continuing success, and on the fact
that he had been permitted to come home <i>via</i> the
Mediterranean, and was to act for his firm in
Paris.</p>

<p>Now, after an absence of fourteen months, he
might be home at any moment; but there had been
a gap in the correspondence—no letters for more
than two months. The maternal anxiety would
have communicated itself to the family, if it had
not been that William’s company had heard from
the young man in the interim, and could assure the
anxious Mr. Carter that his son was well and doing
business with eminent talent and success. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
Payson, the head of the establishment, lived in
town, and he was liberal in his praise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter’s mind dwelt upon this with a feeling
of maternal pride, still tempered with anxiety,
when she became aware that Emily and Leigh were
quarreling openly because of the latter’s unfeeling
remark that a girl with a snub nose and freckles
should never do her hair in a Greek knot.</p>

<p>“It’s enough to make a cat laugh,” said Leigh.
“What have you got to balance that knob on the
back of your head?”</p>

<p>“Leigh, dear, don’t plague sister so,” Mrs. Carter
remonstrated mildly.</p>

<p>“As if a boy like Leigh knew anything about a
girl’s hair!” cried Emily indignantly. “It’s a
psyche-knot.”</p>

<p>Leigh laughed derisively; but at this moment,
when the quarrel had become noisy enough to disturb
Mr. Carter, it was interrupted by the entrance
of the morning mail. Miranda, the colored maid
of all work, appeared with a replenished coffee-pot
and a letter for Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>The anxious mother gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>“My goodness—it’s from Willie!”</p>

<p>The interest became general, and five pairs of
expectant eyes focussed on Mrs. Carter as she
opened the envelope, her fingers shaking with
eagerness. Miranda, to whom the fifth pair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
eyes belonged, became unusually attentive to Daniel,
and insisted on replenishing his coffee-cup.</p>

<p>“This was written in Paris,” Mrs. Carter exclaimed
eagerly, “and—and posted in New York!
I wonder! ‘Dear mother,’” she began reading
aloud, her voice tremulous with joy, “‘I’m coming
home on the <i>Britannic</i>, and I’m bringing you the—the——’”</p>

<p>She stopped short, her mouth open like a fish’s,
and a look of horror glazing the rapture in her
eyes.</p>

<p>There was a profound and expectant pause.
Daniel, the least interested member of the group,
managed to drink his hot coffee with apparent
relish, and sixteen-year-old Emily ate a biscuit,
but Mr. Carter, who had laid down his newspaper
to listen, became impatient.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mama?” he asked peevishly.
“You look scared. Is William going to
bring you a crocodile from the Nile?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rallied.</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly—that is——” She looked
absently at the maid. “Miranda, go down to the
ice-box and look it through. Let me know just
what’s left over. I’ve got to ’phone to the market
immediately.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>Miranda, descrying a sensation from afar, retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
reluctantly. She couldn’t hear quite as well
in the kitchen entry when all the windows were
open.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter waited until the pantry door closed
behind the maid; then she turned her horrified eyes
upon her family.</p>

<p>“William’s married!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Married?” echoed Mr. Carter angrily.
“You’re crazy! William’s got too much sense.
You haven’t read it straight. Give me that letter!”</p>

<p>He stretched out a fiercely impatient hand, but
Mrs. Carter ignored his order.</p>

<p>“Listen! I did read it right. I know my own
boy’s writing. I’ll read it aloud—listen!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter thumped the table.</p>

<p>“Why in thunder don’t you read it, then?
We’re listening! Of all the crazy notions! Married—you’ll
find it’s ‘meandered.’ Go ahead!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rallied her forces again, aware that
Daniel and Leigh and Emily were gaping in
amazed incredulity. She turned the letter over to
the first page, caught her breath, and began.</p>

<p>“‘Dear mother,’” she read again, unsteadily
this time, “‘I’m coming home on the <i>Britannic</i>,
and I’m bringing you the sweetest daughter-in-law
in the whole world. Her name is Fanchon la
Fare, and she’s the cleverest, the dearest, the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
devoted girl in France. I can’t tell you how beautiful
she is, but you’ll fall in love with her at first
sight—just as I did. She’s small, “just as high as
my heart,” mother, and she’s got the eyes of a
wild fawn——’”</p>

<p>“Wild fawn—thunder!” ejaculated Mr. Carter,
unable to restrain himself. “Give me that letter!”</p>

<p>This time Mrs. Carter surrendered it. She
passed it down <i>via</i> Daniel, who was looking unusually
pale. His face startled her, and, while Mr.
Carter was reading the letter, she met her second
son’s eyes. They gave her another shock.</p>

<p>“Dan,” she whispered in an awe-struck voice,
“I—do you think he was engaged to—to——”</p>

<p>She mouthed a name, unable to finish her sentence
under the young man’s look. Daniel
frowned, his white lips closing in a sharp line, but
Emily spoke up unabashed.</p>

<p>“Willie’s engaged to Virginia Denbigh. She’s
got his ring. I’ve seen it on her finger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emily!” her mother sank back in her chair,
feeling weaker than ever. Her boy, her Willie!
She couldn’t believe that he would do anything
like that. She shook her head indignantly at
Emily. “Hush!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“He is, too!” her daughter insisted. “Why,
mama, you know he is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Mrs. Carter cast a miserable glance at her husband,
who was still reading the letter. He was a
big, broad-shouldered man, with a ruddy face and
bristling gray hair. Although usually a man of
fairly equable temperament, his expression at the
moment was almost ferocious. He had grown
very red, and his eyebrows were bushed out over
the bridge of his nose in a scowl that transformed
him.</p>

<p>Leigh nudged the unsympathetic Emily under
the table.</p>

<p>“Gee, look at father!” he murmured.</p>

<p>Emily, who had resumed her breakfast, nodded
with her mouth full. She had played the trump
card, and she was quietly observing Daniel. He
was as white as a sheet, she thought, and those
big eyes of his had a way of smoldering.</p>

<p>“It’s because he’s had a bad night, I suppose,”
Emily mused, “or else——”</p>

<p>She speculated, gazing at him; but she did not
arrive at any conclusion. She was interrupted
by a furious sound from the foot of the table. It
was fortunately smothered, but it had the rumble
of an approaching tornado.</p>

<p>“The young donkey!” Mr. Carter exclaimed
aloud. “My word, I thought William Carter had
sense!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter’s amiable, distressed face emerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
a little from behind the big silver hot-water urn
which had descended in the family, along with a
Revolutionary sword and the copper warming-pans.</p>

<p>“Can you find out anything, Johnson?” she
asked faintly. “I—I can’t! He doesn’t even say
where they were married or—or anything.”</p>

<p>“Married in a lunatic asylum, I suppose,” Mr.
Carter returned fiercely. “He says—as plain as
can be—that he hasn’t known the creature three
months!”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! I didn’t get as far as that,
I——”</p>

<p>William’s mother stopped short; she was afraid
of making matters worse. Emily, who had stopped
eating to listen, came suddenly to the surface.</p>

<p>“Listen, mama! She’s French, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose so, dear.” Mrs. Carter shuddered
slightly. “I’m afraid she is.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how Willie did it in three
months. I read somewhere—in a magazine, I
think—that it took months and months to court a
French girl, and both parents have to say ‘yes,’
and you’ve got to have birth certificates, and the
banns have to be posted for three weeks, and even
then you can’t do it in a hurry; you’ve got to have
a civil marriage and a religious marriage, and—and
everything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Good Lord, Emmy! How does a fellow run
away with his best girl?” Leigh asked.</p>

<p>“He can’t!” Emily, having the floor, held it
proudly. “He just can’t! It wouldn’t be legal;
he’s got to have his birth certificate.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Mr. Carter glared over the top of
William’s letter at his wife. “William didn’t
happen to carry his birth certificate hung around
his neck, did he?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter shook her head, her eyes fixed on
Emily. For the first time she felt it was to be
her portion to hear wisdom from the mouths of
babes and sucklings.</p>

<p>“Emmy, are you sure you read all that?” she
inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course she did, mother,” said Daniel,
speaking for the first time, his low, deep voice
breaking in on the shrill excitement of the family
clamor. “It’s French law.”</p>

<p>That settled it. Daniel had studied law in old
Judge Jessup’s office, and there was nothing in
law, domestic and international, that Judge Jessup
didn’t know. Mr. Carter turned his distorted
countenance upon his second son.</p>

<p>“Is that really a fact, Dan?”</p>

<p>Dan nodded. He was not eating. He had thrust
aside an almost untouched breakfast. The hand
that he stretched out now for a glass of water was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
a little unsteady, but his father did not notice it.
Mr. Carter was scowling at the letter again.</p>

<p>“It’s as plain as day here, he’s known her less
than three months. Take three weeks for the
banns out of that, and you get seven or eight
weeks. The young donkey! Where were her people,
I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter gasped. Horrible thoughts had
been assailing her from the first, and she could no
longer suppress them.</p>

<p>“D-do you think she can be respectable?” she
quavered tearfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was mute. He had no adequate language
in which to express his own views upon that
point, but his gloomy look was eloquent.</p>

<p>There was a horrible pause. Leigh and Emily
exchanged glances. There was a little satisfaction
in hers; she had exploded a bombshell second only
to William’s letter, and now she interrupted her
father’s forty-second perusal of that document.</p>

<p>“Papa,” she said in her solemn young voice,
“Willie was engaged to Virginia Denbigh, and I
don’t believe she’s broken it off at all!”</p>

<p>“Hush up, Emmy!” cried Daniel angrily.
“Leave Virginia Denbigh out of it. You’ve no
right to talk about her. William’s married!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got a right to tell the truth!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Emily flared up. “Willie was engaged to Virginia
Denbigh up to last week—and I know it!”</p>

<p>But, to her surprise, it was Leigh who broke out
suddenly.</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” he cried. “If William’s
fallen in love at first sight, he can’t help it,
can he? It’s too much for a fellow, isn’t it?
When a man sees a woman he loves at first sight—it’s—it’s
like a tornado, it bowls him over!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter turned and stared at his youngest
son. So did his mother. Leigh was a high-school
boy preparing for college. Emily, blond and snub-nosed
and honest, had missed beauty by the proverbial
inch that’s as good as a mile, but Leigh
was a handsome boy. He had the eyes of a girl,
too.</p>

<p>“Love at first sight?” bellowed Mr. Carter, getting
his breath. “What d’you know about it, you—you
young idiot?”</p>

<p>Leigh reddened, but he held his ground.</p>

<p>“I know—how I’d feel,” he replied hotly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Leigh!” his mother smiled indulgently.
“You’re such a child!”</p>

<p>“I’m not!” he retorted with spirit. “I’m eighteen—I’m
a man!”</p>

<p>Emily giggled provokingly, and Mr. Carter
struck the table with his fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Shut up!” he roared. “I’ve got one donkey—I
don’t want another! What did you say, Emily?”</p>

<p>“I said Willie was engaged to Virginia Denbigh
and——”</p>

<p>Daniel, with a suppressed groan of anger, rose
from the table; but his father stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he said sharply. “I want to get the
stuffing out of this. What do you mean, Emily?”</p>

<p>“I mean just exactly what I say, papa,” cried
his daughter, giving Daniel a look of triumph.
“Virginia’s got Willie’s ring on the third finger
of her left hand, and he wrote her letters—love-letters—from
Japan. I guess I know; I saw her
reading one. I guess any girl could tell that!”</p>

<p>“You’re nothing but a child!” Mr. Carter exclaimed
angrily, but he was searching back in his
own mind. He had always planned this match between
his favorite son and Virginia Denbigh, and
Emily’s words went home. He reddened. “Dan,
do you know anything about this?” he demanded,
turning on his son.</p>

<p>Daniel, who was standing with his hand on the
back of his chair, just as he had risen, averted his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not say anything about it, father,”
he replied after a moment. “It’s—it’s not fair
to Miss Denbigh, is it, to discuss it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>His father, who had been observing him narrowly,
thrust William’s letter into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I see it’s true,” he remarked dryly, “Emily’s
got more candor than you have, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Daniel made no reply to this. He reached for
his cane and moved silently toward the door, aware
of Emily’s cryptic gaze.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, meanwhile, broke out stormily
again, striking the edge of the table.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of William!” he growled. “My
son—and no sense of honor! I—I’d like to thrash
him!”</p>

<p>No one replied to this. Daniel opened the door,
went out, and closed it gently behind him. In the
pause they heard his slow, slightly halting tread as
he went across the hall to the front porch and
descended the steps. As the last echo of his footsteps
died away, Emily turned to her father.</p>

<p>“Why, papa, didn’t you know why Dan wouldn’t
tell about Willie and Virginia?” she asked wisely.</p>

<p>Her father cast a startled look at her, his eyes
still clouded with wrath and mortification.</p>

<p>“No. Why?”</p>

<p>Emily smiled across at Leigh.</p>

<p>“Dan’s in love with Virginia himself, and Willie
cut him out. That’s why!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter stared at her with exasperation. She
was going a little too far, and her annihilation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
was impending when Mrs. Carter suddenly uttered
a cry of horror. She had picked up the newspaper.
It was local, but it often copied bits from the New
York dailies, when the bits were likely to interest
the town.</p>

<p>“Oh, good gracious, here’s a marriage notice
from a New York paper!” she cried, pointing it
out with a shaking forefinger: “‘William Henry
Carter and Fanchon la Fare.’ Papa, they weren’t
married until they got to New York—the very
day Willie posted that letter!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter snatched the paper from her hand
and read the notice; then he slammed it down on
the table with a violence that made all the dishes
rattle. He was fairly choking with rage now.</p>

<p>“Came over on the steamer with him, of
course!” he shouted. “You get the idea, mama?
A French girl! Came over on the same steamer—seven—nine
days at sea—and got married in
New York. My word!” he fairly bellowed. “What
kind of a daughter-in-law d’you think we’ve got?
I ask you that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa—sh!” gasped his wife weakly.
“Think of these children——”</p>

<p>“Sh?” he shouted. “Sh? With this thing out
in black and white? D’you think people haven’t
got eyes? The whole town’ll read it—trust ’em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
for that! French laws—birth certificates—banns—chaperons—I’d
like to see ’em—wow!”</p>

<p>There was a crash of china, and Mrs. Carter rose
and fairly thrust Leigh and Emily out of the room.
For the first time in her experience with him, Mr.
Carter had become volcanic.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Carter</span>, having left the family conclave
so abruptly, descended the steps to the garden-path
and walked slowly—almost painfully, it appeared—to
the gate.</p>

<p>He was a tall young man of twenty-five, thin
from long suffering, and a little angular, and he
was lame. He was not using a crutch now. Dr.
Barbour had succeeded in alleviating the old
trouble and Daniel could do very well with a walking-stick.
But his face, pale and hollow-cheeked,
showed the lines of old suffering, and to-day there
were dark rings around his fine eyes. The fact
was that, at that moment, his heart was beating
so heavily that its clamor seemed to fill his ears.
A strange thing had befallen him. He had been
stricken with horror and anguish at an insult to
one he loved, and—almost at the same instant—he
had felt a wild, unreasoning relief. It would
not do, he must not let his mind dwell upon it.
The habit of repression, the habit of endurance,
the older habit of suffering, came to his aid. He
set his teeth and walked straight out of the front
gate and down to the end of the street. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
paused almost unconsciously, because this spot, at
the side of a hill, gave him a wide view of the
town, and he often stopped here a moment on his
way to and from Judge Jessup’s office, just to
catch this glimpse of his native hills. The poet
in Daniel loved this view.</p>

<p>The sun was on the hills to-day, except where
the shadow of a passing cloud moved across the
wide vista like a pillar of smoke to guide the wayfarers
toward the Promised Land. The sun shone,
too, on the roofs of the houses that clustered at
Daniel’s feet, and it caught the gilt on a cross-crowned
spire and flashed it against the background
of the trees. The only vivid thing, it
seemed, in the whole scene, where the gray of old
shingled roofs and the sober tints of the time-worn
houses blended with the greens and browns
of nature. For it’s an old town, nestled in the
hills, at the southern edge of one of the Middle
States. A State, by the way, that is a good deal
more southern than middle. So old is the town,
indeed, that its tree-embowered streets have been
trodden by the valiants of other days. The early
settlers came here and found the spot fair, Indian
traders bartered here, and heroes of the Revolution
lie buried in the quaint old cemetery. The
place has been long asleep, napping sweetly in the
southern sunshine, drowsy and fragrant and restful—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
a summer day. But lately the stirring of
greater things has begun in the town. Life has
grown busier, more noisy, more insistent. The
ancient aristocracy has begun to feel the wave of
democracy at its threshold, the old kernel is bursting
and the strong young oak is thrusting its tap-root
down into the rich black loam of the ages.
But the background is unchanged, the fond heart
can still dwell on the lovely profile of the blue
hills, melting at noon into the more ineffable blue
of the sky, and upon the dark green cloak of verdure
that enfolds the foot-hills, and unrolls its
ample edges to the very rim of the meadows.</p>

<p>The grape-vines still blossom fragrantly in the
backyards of the old-fashioned dwellings, where
negro slaves used to flit in and out, and, at evening
still, sweet negro melodies float along the highways.
Awhile ago, when Johnson Carter was a
child, turbaned mammies used to fry chickens and
make beaten biscuits to sell at the railway station—then
a mere wayside shed with a platform. They
saved many a famished traveler in the days when
dining-cars were few and far between. Though,
curiously enough, there were never any parts to a
chicken but its legs. Tradition paints them as
chicken centipedes, though hunger relished even a
drumstick and a soggy, beaten biscuit. Little
pickaninnies hung about, too, peddling chincapins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
while an elderly matron of a sow disported herself
in the adjacent gutter. But behind them, and in
spite of them, the town stood enfolded in its lovely
verdure and its blossomings, like an ancient bride
in a constantly rejuvenated wedding garment,
smiling and peaceful and secure.</p>

<p>Daniel Carter loved the town. Ambition might
lead him elsewhere, but his heart would linger affectionately
here. There was an unbreakable tie—he
had suffered here, both in the flesh and in
the spirit. He had lived his happy childhood here,
whole and sound. He had climbed the hills and
raced across the meadows. Then came his accident,
the long interval of pain, and the deadly certainty,
at last, that he was crippled. But through
it all the trees had rustled their new leaves and
the heavenly hills had lifted up their heads. Pain
forges a tie deeper than the ties of joy. Dan loved
the town.</p>

<p>As he walked down the old street to-day its familiarity
eased the pang at his heart. His pain
was vicarious, he imagined how Virginia Denbigh
would suffer when she knew. He raged, too,
against his brother—the brother whom he had always
loved and trusted! For there had been a
bond between the two elder Carter boys, cemented
by the death of the two children who came between
Daniel and Leigh. Now, a reflection of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
father’s anger at William sent the blood up to
Daniel’s pale forehead. He was very sensitive for
the honor of the Carters, and William’s conduct—in
Daniel’s eyes—constituted a high breach of
honor, it was conduct, in fact, unbecoming a gentleman.</p>

<p>And Virginia Denbigh——?</p>

<p>Words failed; a kind of blind fury seized him;
he longed to cross the ocean, or to meet the
steamer in New York, and drag the strong, powerfully
built William all the way upon his knees to
Virginia’s feet, to beg her pardon.</p>

<p>He was thinking this, with a stinging and humiliating
consciousness of his own physical disability,
when he finally turned from his post of
observation and began to descend the hill which
led to Judge Jessup’s office. It was a curious fact
that his mental state had an effect on his bodily
affliction, and, when his mind was in conflict, his
limp—usually no more than a slow, halting step—became
almost painful. He was limping very
badly and leaning on his cane when he saw an
equipage approaching that was as unmistakable
as Noah’s ark would have been, had it been harnessed
to a couple of stout old dappled grays and
started on the turnpike to Ararat. This was an
old-fashioned wagonette, drawn by two elderly
grays, and driven by George Washington Lucas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
old Uncle Plato’s grandson, a coal black negro, attired
in a rubbishy bottle-green livery and a white
straw hat.</p>

<p>Alone on one of the rear seats, which ran length-wise
in the wagonette, was a slim figure in a flowered
organdy, with a wide leghorn hat looped down
at the sides by the broad pink ribbons that were
knotted coquettishly under her chin. It was an
old hat, made to do, if the truth be told, but it
framed a charming face, and shaded the eyes that
were greeting Daniel Carter.</p>

<p>At a word from her Lucas drew rein and she
leaned forward, smiling.</p>

<p>“Let me give you a lift, Dan,” she called to him,
sweetly.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Daniel’s heart sank
at the sound of Virginia Denbigh’s voice. He
came up, hat in hand, to answer her, and Virginia
was startled, in her turn, for Daniel was blushing.
He was red to his hair and it gave a bizarre effect
to his usually pale face. “He’s hurt because he
thinks I pity his lameness,” Virginia thought.</p>

<p>“We’re going the same way, Dan. Get in, I feel
queer sitting here all by my lonesome,” she said
gaily. “Grandpa couldn’t come to-day.”</p>

<p>But he could not get in. The thought of taking
advantage of her kindness when he knew what his
brother had done, was too much for Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Thank you a thousand times, but I’ve only got
a few steps to go now, Virginia,” he replied, forcing
a smile though his lips felt stiff. “The colonel
isn’t ill, is he?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s planting,” she laughed, puzzled by
the young man’s manner. What could be the matter
with him? she wondered. “I’ve got to do the
marketing, get the mail and buy a newspaper.
Some one stole ours this morning. Has—have you
heard from William yet, Dan?”</p>

<p>Daniel had laid one hand on the edge of the
wagonette while they spoke, it tightened now—as
something seemed to tighten about his heart. He
couldn’t tell her!</p>

<p>“Mother got a letter this morning.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s clear eyes fixed on him, discerning
something behind his words. She blushed suddenly
and painfully, leaning back in her seat.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad! Mrs. Carter was so anxious. I
haven’t heard myself for a long time,” she added
steadily, bending another searching look on William’s
brother.</p>

<p>Daniel could not meet it; he flinched. “He’s
quite well,” he said thickly, “he’s in New York
now, I think. He was to sail on the <i>Britannic</i>.
She ought to be in.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Virginia’s exclamation was involuntary, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
died in her throat. What could it mean? No letter
and William in New York? Then suddenly
she colored with happiness, her heart beating
wildly. Of course! She understood it now; it accounted
for the silence, too. She leaned forward,
her clasped hands on her knees, her eyes—beautiful
and soft and caressing—dwelling upon the
unhappy Daniel.</p>

<p>“I know—he means to surprise me!” she cried.
“Dan, you shouldn’t have told.”</p>

<p>Daniel experienced a feeling of dissolution. He
withdrew his hand from the wagonette, and leaned
heavily on his cane. To let her think this, and to-morrow——!</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think that’s just the idea, Virginia,”
he said gravely.</p>

<p>She met his eyes, still radiant; then, slowly, reluctantly,
the light faded from hers, and the color
receded from her cheeks, even from her lips. She
gasped. Then she glanced around at the stout,
unmoved back of George Washington Lucas. To
her aroused perception even his ears seemed to
move, and she was heavily aware that the nigh
horse was stamping an impatient foot, troubled
by an insistent fly. She moved nearer to the end
of the wagonette and bent over Daniel, her eyes
fixed on his face again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Did—did he speak of me, Dan?” she asked in
a low voice.</p>

<p>Daniel swallowed the lump in his throat. “I—I
don’t know—I didn’t see the letter.”</p>

<p>She drew back, blushing as quickly as she had
paled. With an odd little groping gesture she put
up her hand and pulled at the pink bow under her
chin. Then she laughed, and the sound of her
laughter hurt him like a blow.</p>

<p>“I’m keeping you,” she said lightly. “Give my
love to your mother. I’m sorry you won’t come
with me. Drive on, Lucas.”</p>

<p>Daniel stood back, bare-headed, following her
with his eyes, his heart in a tumult. He felt as if
he had struck her, and yet he had not told her the
worst.</p>

<p>As the old horses started, Virginia remembered
him. She looked back and waved her hand.</p>

<p>“Goodbye!” she called to him, and, after a
moment: “Good luck!”</p>

<p>Daniel stood gazing after her. He found himself,
for the moment, unable to move. He watched
until the old wagonette, with that slim young
figure so erect at the side of it, vanished in a cloud
of dust in the distance. It seemed to him that his
heart stood still, too, within him. For the first
time in his life he felt helpless, he felt physically
as if he had been beaten. Why had he been forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to do it? Why, he stormed inwardly, was it his
lot to give her the first warning? How she would
hate him! Hereafter he would be in the same class
with William, she would despise the whole family.
He stood there shuddering, and he might have remained
there a long time if old Mrs. Payson had
not driven past in her new motor-car and shrilled
to him that it was a “fine morning,” and she had
seen something—he didn’t catch what it was—in
the morning paper.</p>

<p>It roused him, he straightened himself and
walked on, as fast as his limp permitted.</p>

<p>Judge Jessup was already at his desk when
Daniel opened the door. He growled a greeting,
sorting his mail. The judge had a high Roman
nose and the kind of chin we associate with Benjamin
Franklin. Owing to a formidable growth of
eyebrow, his expression was sometimes abnormally
fierce. But this morning there was a gleam
of triumph in his eye.</p>

<p>“We’ve won that Ryan appeal,” he announced
in his deep voice. “Judge Loomis handed down
his decision just before court adjourned yesterday.
Hear about it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The judge went on opening his letters, while his
young pupil and associate took off his coat, hung
it up and sat down at his own desk in his shirt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
sleeves. He was very pale now and he began to
work mechanically, scarcely aware of the older
man’s fiery way of disposing of his own business.</p>

<p>“Old man Barbour has kicked up another shindy
with Allen,” the judge continued. “I reckon we’ll
get that case, too. By the way, did you look up
that option for Allen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” the judge rubbed his chin and
turned his swivel chair slightly. He could see
Daniel now sitting at his desk, his white face set
and his hands lying idle on a folded sheet of paper.
He was staring straight in front of him. The
judge prodded again.</p>

<p>“Kenslaw wants you to handle his case. I
reckon you’d like that, eh?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, sir.”</p>

<p>The judge eyed the young man critically.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Dan? Got the pip?”</p>

<p>Daniel, a little startled, smiled and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter, Judge.”</p>

<p>The judge shrugged, turned to his desk and
spread out the morning paper. His eye fell suddenly
on that item in the column of personal mention
which had already smitten the Carter family.
He stared at it a moment in silence. Then he began
to whistle softly, and his eyes fixed themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
on a spot at the far end of the tree-shaded street.
It was a white guide-post and on it was printed, in
large black letters, the magic words:</p>

<p>“1½ miles to Denbigh Crossing.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Denbigh</span> was walking to and fro at the
back of his house, considering it. There was no
doubt at all that it needed a new coat of paint.
It needed it almost as much as the colonel needed
the extra money to pay for it. He chuckled a
little, pulling at the ends of his long white moustache.</p>

<p>“Neither of us likely to get it,” he thought,
“and I reckon I look almost as much out of repair
as the old place does anyway!”</p>

<p>Then his eye traveled down the long road which
led to the town. He was expecting his granddaughter
and the morning newspaper. Viewed
from this angle, the road was a thing of beauty.
It turned a curve above the crossing and passed
through a grove of chestnuts. They were yellowish-white
now with bloom. Beneath them the road
ran like a ribbon, while on either hand the colonel
glimpsed the friendly roofs of his neighbors’
houses. The farthest one, set back among the
trees, was Johnson Carter’s. Over there was
Judge Jessup’s; beyond that was the spire of the
oldest church. In the graveyard behind it four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
generations of Denbighs lay buried. At the corner
of Mrs. Payson’s place a blossoming pear tree
stood like a lovely ghost. The warm, still atmosphere
was filled with the fragrance of early blossomings,
here and there a field was pink with
clover. There was a warmth, a stirring, the promise
of a hundred springs in the rich loam, where
the new grass thrust up its strong young blades,
and in the old apple-tree that showered the colonel’s
shoulder with its falling petals. He found
some of them on his sleeve and looked at them
musingly; he was thinking of the days when he
had gathered apples from that tree for his wife.
Mrs. Denbigh had been dead many years, and their
only son and his wife. Gone, too! The old man
took off his hat and passed his hand absently over
his white head, a little sadness in the very gesture.
Virginia and he were the only ones left, he
reflected, and then he smiled. He always smiled
when he thought of Virginia. He was very proud
of his young granddaughter.</p>

<p>“There’s a girl for you!” he thought fondly,
“pretty as a picture. A straight-thinking kind of
a young creature, too, bless her heart!”</p>

<p>He was sorry that his estate did not warrant a
little of the old-time style for her. She deserved
it, but—the colonel shook his head, eying the
house again. It was a rambling, old-fashioned affair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
with a belvidere on the flat roof and two
verandas. It had a beauty of its own, fortunately,
for it had lost a good deal of its exterior decorations
and it was deplorably weather-stained on
the north side.</p>

<p>The colonel was still viewing it when the dogs
began to bark at the lower gate. He turned quickly
and saw his two big pointers greeting Mr. Carter.
But that gentleman did not notice them as much
as usual. There was, indeed, something odd about
him. His stout, middle-aged figure seemed to sag
down a little at the shoulders and his head
drooped. He looked, as he came slowly up the
path, like the bearer of bad tidings. He shuffled
as he walked and seemed interested in his feet.</p>

<p>The colonel, a little surprised at this early visit,
shouted a greeting to him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Carter! What’s the matter? You’re
walking as if”—the colonel chuckled—“as if
you had a bunion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter raised his abashed eyes reluctantly
to the old man’s fine, smiling face.</p>

<p>“I declare I felt as if I’d been stealing his
chickens!” he told Mrs. Carter afterwards. However,
he achieved a moment of cordiality as he
shook the colonel’s hand.</p>

<p>“I—I was coming this way,” he said a little
hoarsely; he wasn’t a good liar. “I thought I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
just drop in. How’s the garden coming on? I’ve
put in my limas.”</p>

<p>The colonel, eying him, pulled his moustache.</p>

<p>“They’ll rot. It’s too early. Plato told me that
the peas were up well and we’ve got spinach. Sit
down, Carter, I’ll call Plato. Have a julep? Or
is it too early?”</p>

<p>“Too early altogether. I—the fact is, I can’t
stay but a minute. I——” Mr. Carter glanced
around wildly, groping for a topic, any topic, to
introduce his subject. His choice wasn’t exactly
an apt one. “I see that speckled hen of yours
gets out of the coop still.”</p>

<p>His host looked around.</p>

<p>“So she does! Can’t keep her in at all. Kind
of strong-minded. She’s got fifteen chicks, too.
Wanting a setting of leghorn eggs, Carter? I
can give you one. Got the finest lot of layers in
the county.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter continued to stare moodily at the
speckled hen; she had led him astray.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied thoughtfully. “I’ll—I’ll
ask Mrs. Carter.”</p>

<p>The colonel stared.</p>

<p>Plato, a gray-headed old negro, appeared.</p>

<p>“Wants yo’ juleps, Col’nel?”</p>

<p>“Not now, Plato. Mr. Carter says it’s too
early.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Plato grinned and bowed to the visitor.</p>

<p>“Howdy, suh. Hopes yo’-all is well. Heared
from yo’ son, suh?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter’s heart jumped and then sank with
a thud. Plato had achieved it.</p>

<p>“This morning, Plato. He’s in New York now,
I hope. He’s well, too, and—and——”</p>

<p>“I’se sho glad t’ heah it, suh,” said Plato and
withdrew, still bowing.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, with his mouth open, stared after
him helplessly. He felt now that he should never
get his news out unless some one shook it out of
him! The colonel did not help him.</p>

<p>“So! Well, I’m glad William’s coming back.
We’ve missed him. Judge Jessup was speaking
of him last night. A fine fellow, he thinks him.
By the way, Carter, Jessup gave me a young apple-tree
last spring. There’s something the matter
with it. I believe it’s got San José scale. Come
here and look at it, will you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter trailed the colonel’s tall, thin figure
across the lawn, and the two pointers came to
meet them.</p>

<p>“Down, Jim! Down, Rover!” ordered the colonel,
reaching the tree. “There—if you’ll look
close along that lower limb—see?”</p>

<p>His visitor approached the limb indicated and
stared at it moodily. Then he swallowed hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Think it’s scale?” the colonel asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Darned if I know!” said Mr. Carter violently.
“Denbigh, I came to tell you—— The fact is, my
son’s made an ass of himself. He——”</p>

<p>“Yes?” the colonel stood still, politely amazed.
“Which son, Carter?”</p>

<p>“William. He—he’s married!”</p>

<p>There was a little silence and then the colonel
laughed dryly.</p>

<p>“Was that what ailed you? On my word, Carter,
I began to think you’d got creeping paralysis
of the brain. Who’s he married?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t! It’s some French girl—Fanchon—there,
I can’t remember! We just heard this
morning. The—the young donkey hasn’t known
her three months.”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh broke off a twig and began to
whittle it.</p>

<p>“Case of love at first sight, I presume,” he commented
calmly. “I wouldn’t take it so hard, Carter,
you may like her.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made an inarticulate sound which
ended in his throat. His eyes avoided the colonel’s.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carter’s all broken up,” he said hoarsely.
“It’s a shock. Of course we don’t know anything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
But—that is—I—I’m afraid, William’s behaved
badly. Virginia, you know?”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh started slightly. Then he
closed his pocket-knife and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“What about Virginia?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter hesitated, then he reddened. “You
know how we all love you and Virginia,” he said
hurriedly. “We—we hoped there was something—the
fact is, Emily says William was—was engaged
to Virginia. I—I want to know, Colonel.
I want to know if my boy’s behaved like that?”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, Mr. Carter,” replied the
colonel loftily. “No man who was engaged to
Virginia Denbigh could, or would, forget it.”</p>

<p>“But, Colonel, I thought——” Mr. Carter was
purple now with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, sir,” the colonel held his
head high, “entirely mistaken.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter felt like a gold fish splashed out of
its globe. He gasped and swallowed hard. He
remembered, too, that his wife had told him not
to come. “You’ll only make a mess of it, papa,”
she had warned him, between her sobs, “You’re
always putting your foot in it!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Colonel. I—well, you see—it
was because I think so much of her—of Virginia,
I mean, that I came. I—I thought if my
boy—my boy, William Henry Carter, had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
a thing like that— Well, sir, I’d feel like disowning
him!”</p>

<p>The colonel stood still. He had thrust his
thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat, and his
eyes were fixed on the distant road.</p>

<p>“You were mistaken, sir, that’s all. There
comes Jinny now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, following his eyes, saw the ancient
wagonette entering the old gateway. Lucas was
driving placidly, the old grays were ambling up
the broad moss-grown driveway to the front door.
Alone in the back sat a slim young figure. Virginia
was reading a newspaper. Mr. Carter
remembered that fearful item in the personals and
cold perspiration stood out in beads on his forehead.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go,” he said thickly. “I’m late
now at the office. We’ve been all upset.”</p>

<p>“Better look at this San José scale,” said the
colonel grimly, his eyes still on the wagonette.</p>

<p>Lucas had stopped half-way to the house and
Virginia jumped down. She was coming toward
them now. In one hand she held the newspaper,
in the other some hothouse roses. Mr. Carter,
making hot-foot for the gate, came full upon her.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Carter!” she smiled radiantly. “I
didn’t know you were here.”</p>

<p>“I—I stopped by to get a setting of leghorn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
eggs,” said Mr. Carter, mopping his forehead.
“It’s a hot day, Virginia.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “I thought it was cool. Please
take this rose to Mrs. Carter from me, won’t you?
Mrs. Payson just cut them for me; they’re from
her new greenhouse. She calls them ‘Kentucky
Sunsets.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter took the rose and stumbled blindly
for the open. He was suffocating with mortification.
If William wasn’t engaged to her, he, Johnson
Carter, had made a donkey of himself, and if
William was engaged to her! Mr. Carter wiped
his forehead again, absently thrust the rose inside
the crown of his hat and set the hat firmly on his
head with the rose leaves hanging out at the back—like
the tail of a kite. They were still fluttering
there as he plodded down the road toward
his office, his face red and his heart sore.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Colonel Denbigh had crossed the
lawn to meet his granddaughter. Virginia gave
him the newspaper without comment and retired
to an old stone bench near the rustic table which
served her grandfather as a writing-desk and refreshment
table in summer time. She was engaged
now in arranging Mrs. Payson’s roses while
the colonel pretended to read the news. They
both heard the horses going around to the stable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and Lucas’ voice as he called to them to go into
their stalls.</p>

<p>The colonel rustled the newspaper and laid it
down. Then he took off his hat and pushed back
his white hair. He was a brave man, but he was
perspiring at every pore.</p>

<p>“Jinny,” he said at last, so abruptly that she
started and looked around. He caught her eye,
winced, and plunged in. “Mr. Carter was here
just now.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Virginia listened expectantly, a little
flush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>The colonel wiped his forehead. “It’s a hot
day!” he observed. Then, casually: “Yes; he’s
heard from his son. He’s coming home with——”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Virginia drew her breath quietly, averting
her eyes. “Soon, grandpa?”</p>

<p>The colonel choked. He had to go to the table
and drain a glass of water. “Yes. He—he’s
made a darned fool of himself, Jinny, he’s—he’s
married.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Virginia rejoined in a low voice. “I
just read it in the newspaper.”</p>

<p>The colonel, looking into the bottom of his
tumbler, was aware that the bees had got into the
honeysuckle. They sounded like a full brass
band in his ears. He could not stand it any longer,
he looked sideways at Virginia. She was still sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
on the old stone bench, her roses in her lap.
She wasn’t looking at him and he could see her
profile. It was very pale now, but she still had
an adorable nose. It came from her mother’s side;
the Denbighs had long ones with a hump, called
politely Roman. Her grandfather, watching her
intently, saw her slip a ring from her finger and
put it into her pocket. As she said nothing, the
colonel got his breath. “She’ll want to know, I’ll
tell her the rest now,” he thought. “It’s like pulling
a tooth—better get it over.”</p>

<p>“He’s married a French girl. Only known her
three months. He’s bringing her home.”</p>

<p>Virginia rose quietly, gathering up her roses.
She started to speak, but her lips trembled and
she gave it up. She put the roses in the bowl on
the colonel’s table and filled the bowl with water.
Her hands were quite firm.</p>

<p>“I hope she’s nice,” she said at last, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>The colonel, who had caught her eye, made a
rash movement, he was going to take her in his
arms. But she straightened herself.</p>

<p>“Please d-d-don’t!” she gasped, and ran up the
steps into the house.</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh stood, looking after her, his
eyes full. Then he smoothed his hair again and
put on his hat. Thrusting his thumbs into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
armholes of his waistcoat he walked up and down.</p>

<p>“She’s game!” he thought proudly. “By gum,
she’s a Denbigh. God bless her!”</p>

<p>At this moment Plato emerged from the house
with a tray.</p>

<p>“It am time fo’ yo’ julep, Col’nel,” he remarked,
setting down a glass that showed a green
sprig of mint in crushed ice.</p>

<p>“Plato,” said the colonel thoughtfully, “what
was it you used to tell me about old Colonel Colfax
and his daughter?”</p>

<p>Plato flicked a little dust off the edge of the
table and showed his ivories.</p>

<p>“Yo means ’bout Miss Ann an’ dat Mist’ Gibbie?”</p>

<p>The colonel nodded, his eyes on the far end of
the sunny path to the orchard.</p>

<p>“Mist’ Gibbie was courtin’ Miss Ann, suh. He
warn’t no ’count at all, no, suh, but Miss Ann, I
reckon she thought a heap of him. Anyways,
Col’nel Colfax, he didn’t say noffin much, no, suh,
he jest kinder watched ’em. Den, ’bout six months
after Mist’ Gibbie come courtin’, jest when we was
all expectin’ a weddin’, come t’ find out Mist’

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a clear, starry night, and the long black
plume of smoke from the engine was plainly visible
as the train rounded the curve and came slowly
up to the station. It seemed to approach solemnly,
with a certain portentous stateliness, its long line
of lighted cars mysteriously welded together and
suggesting a giant caterpillar suffering from internal
conflagration.</p>

<p>The soft spring night, so illusive in its fragrance
and its stillness, was suddenly riven by the fierce
clamor of the monster’s bell, and the long platform
of the station shook and trembled under foot.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter and Daniel waited at the gates, detailed
for this painful duty by the panic-stricken
Mrs. Carter. The train was late, and they had
been waiting fifteen minutes. Daniel patiently
leaned on his cane, while his father gripped the
iron bars at times with the air of an exasperated
tiger looking for a victim. Aware of other people
also waiting and within ear-shot, they had said
little to each other; but as the train finally approached,
Mr. Carter broke out with a suppressed
rumble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“The young donkey!” he said for the hundredth
time. “I—I wonder what I’m here for, anyway?”</p>

<p>Daniel, who had borne a good deal already,
pulled at his sleeve.</p>

<p>“They’ll hear you. For Heaven’s sake, make
the best of it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter gave utterance to a sound that
seemed to be a cross between a grunt and a bellow,
but the thunderous arrival of the engine drowned
all other noises, and he fell silent while he stared
gloomily down the long aisle between the tracks
where the passengers were disembarking.</p>

<p>“There’s William,” said Daniel in his ear.</p>

<p>“Where?” Mr. Carter experienced a strange,
sinking feeling around the diaphragm. “Oh, I
see!”</p>

<p>The two stood silent, trying to get a good view
through the crowd.</p>

<p>“My word, Dan, has he married a kid? She’s
no size at all!”</p>

<p>Dan went forward, his halting walk jarring
anew on his father. Mr. Carter hated to have one
of his boys a cripple, but to-night he felt that
Daniel was heroic. He followed in a panic.</p>

<p>William saw them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dan! How d’you do, father? Here—here’s
your new daughter,” he added in a lower,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
more vibrant tone, drawing his wife forward, pride
in his face.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made a desperate plunge, tried to
think of something to say, stumbled badly, and
surprised himself and both his sons by suddenly
kissing the bride.</p>

<p>“Welcome home!” he said loudly. “We’re all
mighty glad to see you. We——”</p>

<p>He stopped short with his mouth open, amazed
at his own performance. He had never intended
to do anything of the kind. He was suffering from
stage fright, his mind became a blank, and he
simply stared.</p>

<p>But the bride was not at loss. His greeting
seemed to touch her. She held out both hands with
a fluttering, birdlike gesture, one to him and one
to Dan, and she lifted a lovely, animated face.</p>

<p>“<i>Vous parlez Français?</i>” she cried eagerly,
with shining eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter looked about aghast.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, William! Can’t she speak English?”</p>

<p>He was answered with a chorus of laughter.
Young Mrs. Carter, William, and Daniel giggled
outrageously.</p>

<p>“Of course she does, father! She’s half American,”
replied William.</p>

<p>But the laugh had broken the ice. Mr. Carter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
looked more narrowly at his daughter-in-law, and
discovered that her eyes were lovely. She raised
them to his now with a look that suddenly recalled
William’s description. They were soft and brown
and tender, with something sylvan and untamed
in their lucid depths.</p>

<p>“By George, a wild fawn, of course, of course!”
thought Mr. Carter, and he offered her his arm.</p>

<p>She took it, clinging to him a little with a touch
at once soft and confiding. There was the ghost
of an elusive fragrance in her hair, and in the
light veil that floated across his shoulder. It
suggested violets wet with dew, and even Mr. Carter
was intuitively aware that there was something
unique, something distinguished and amazing
about the small figure, so slight and graceful, and
the delicately poised head.</p>

<p>“Of course I speak English,” she murmured
softly in his ear as they threaded the crowd, followed
by William and Daniel and two porters with
innumerable bags. “<i>Mais, hélas!</i> I wanted to
speak French to you because I love it. It’s the
language of my heart, and you”—there was a
lovely tremor in her voice—“you’re so good to
me here in this smoky place—like a father! I—oh,
I know—<i>je t’adore!</i>”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, unaccustomed to the language of
extravagance, had a pleasurable feeling of elation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Hitherto, his performances in the social line had
been unappreciated, even in the bosom of his family.
He had frequently felt like a dancing bear,
but now all was changed; this little French girl
knew a good thing when she saw it.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, you’re William’s wife,” said
Mr. Carter, “and I’m mighty fond of William. His
mother thinks he’s a chip of the moon, I’ll tell you
that!”</p>

<p>“<i>Tiens!</i>” The girl drew in her breath quickly.
“Then I’m afraid—she will never like me!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, who felt that this time he had really
put his foot in it, covered his confusion by hustling
her into a waiting taxi. Daniel and he had secured
one, but it was necessary to take another for the
hand-luggage, and Daniel rode home in that, alone
with the bags and umbrellas, while his father and
William sat with the bride.</p>

<p>Daniel, who had exchanged a word or two with
his brother as they crossed the station together,
was aware of William’s uneasiness. In the familiar
station, confronted with his father and his
brother, and all the old realities of his home life,
William must have suffered some kind of a shock.
He had even said, rather thickly, as they walked
along:</p>

<p>“How are they all? Judge Jessup, Dr. Barbour—the—the Denbighs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Daniel, staring straight before him, had answered
shortly. All their friends were in good health,
he said. But he had previously caught William’s
eye, and something in its expression rankled in
Daniel’s mind. He glanced moodily at the heap
of luggage in the cab with him, topped by a small
green-leather bag with the initials “F. L. F.” in
silver on the flap. She was pretty; he had perceived
the subtle charm of the small, irregular face
and the beautiful, wild eyes. Yet he was not reassured;
he was, in fact, vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>Then he reflected bitterly that he was a prejudiced
judge. He had never been able to get the
look in Virginia Denbigh’s eyes out of his mind.
He could see them still as he gave her the first
warning. The blood went up to Daniel’s ears and
burned there; he abhorred that little green bag.</p>

<p>Both taxis slowed down at the Carters’ door, a
stream of light flowed out of the house, and Mrs.
Carter, frightened and tearful, appeared at the
threshold, supported on either hand by Leigh and
Emily.</p>

<p>Daniel, busying himself with directions about
the hand-luggage, escaped the ordeal of the greeting,
but he caught a glimpse of his mother trying
to be nice to the bride and then crying on William’s
shoulder. When Daniel finally entered the
house, the young stranger had taken off her hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and tossed aside the light furs that she had worn
with such a daring effect of style. Her brother-in-law
was almost startled, she looked so small,
so delicate, and so young. Her hair was fluffy
and dusky and riotously pretty; it escaped into
curls about her little ears and on the nape of her
white neck. Her dress, too, in the extreme of the
prevailing mode, was a little daring in its display
of both neck and ankles.</p>

<p>As Daniel entered, she had discovered Emily,
a gawky girl of sixteen, and was displaying a flattering
interest in her that covered the embarrassed
Emily with blushes. Mrs. Carter tried to save
the situation by urging her daughter-in-law to
come up-stairs.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the very best room ready for you, my
dear,” she said tremulously. “You’ll want to arrange
your things and come right down. We’ve
waited supper for you.”</p>

<p>“How sweet of you, <i>maman</i>! I may call you
<i>maman</i>, mayn’t I?” She laid a light hand on Mrs.
Carter’s arm, raising her soft eyes to her face.
“If I’m good I may call you that—<i>toujours—toujours,
n’est-ce-pas?</i>”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Fanchon, don’t talk
French to mother!” her husband exclaimed. “She
doesn’t know a word of it—and you can speak
English.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“I used to speak French quite a little, Willie,”
Mrs. Carter protested, coloring faintly; “but I—I’m
a little rusty!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter laughed.</p>

<p>“Mama can just about say, ‘<i>oui, oui</i>,’ like a
pig,” he said bluntly. “You women hurry up; I
want my supper.”</p>

<p>Fanchon, with one foot on the stairs, turned
and kissed her hand to him.</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” she declared. “I’m starving,
too. I won’t be ten minutes!”</p>

<p>“She means two hours,” said William, his eyes
following the small figure with a look that did not
escape either his father or Daniel.</p>

<p>“She’s turned his head,” the latter thought
moodily, not unaware of the charm of the light,
hurrying voice and the accent, delicate and sweet,
that made her English so exotic.</p>

<p>At the moment, too, Leigh appeared, laden with
Fanchon’s luggage. Like a beast of burden he
toiled up behind the women, plainly captivated.
William, seeing it, grinned and laid his hand on
Daniel’s shoulder. Daniel was the only one who
had, so far, shown no signs of capitulation.</p>

<p>“Well, Dan, got any of those old cigarettes in
your room?” he asked jocularly.</p>

<p>Daniel yielded, returning his smile, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
two brothers, anxious perhaps for a little talk together,
went up-stairs.</p>

<p>Left alone—marooned, as it were—on the old
Turkey rug in the hall, Mr. Carter prowled about
for a moment, his mind in a maze. He looked into
the dining-room, wondered if supper was ready,
and finally went into the library and sank heavily
into his favorite chair. He had a confused feeling
of amazement that the room looked just as usual—the
same old books around the walls, the same
old portrait of an ancestral Carter over the fireplace,
and the guttered chairs, looking as homelike
and shabby as ever. Even the litter on the table—it
hadn’t set itself in order, this corner of the
house having escaped the cleaning up for the
bride. There was the same old lamp in the center,
and his old brier-wood lay there, too.</p>

<p>He sighed, slowly rubbing the back of his head
with one hand, while he gazed reflectively at the
other. He was confusedly aware of an elusive
fragrance about his fingers, the ghost of a perfume,
and he had a dazzled consciousness of those
wild-fawn eyes, and the red lips, and little pointed
chin. He had a guilty recollection, too, of calling
his son a young donkey.</p>

<p>He was still sitting there, staring into the vacant
fireplace, when he heard the rustle of skirts
and felt his wife’s entrance. He did not look up;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
he seemed to feel an unsympathetic atmosphere,
and he heard Mrs. Carter drop into a chair by
the table with a heaviness that suggested collapse
after an ordeal.</p>

<p>He waited, expectant, but nothing happened.
The silence, in fact, grew rather thick. Mrs. Carter
sat there, saying nothing, though she swallowed
once or twice rather audibly. Unable to
endure it any longer, her husband broke the pause.</p>

<p>“She’s mighty pretty,” he said at last, apparently
addressing the fireplace.</p>

<p>His wife said nothing. She only turned a slow,
absent look toward him, her mind at work on some
problem too deep for him.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll turn out better than we thought,
mama,” he ventured again.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” she assented reluctantly. “Poor
Willie.”</p>

<p>“Poor fiddlesticks! He’s in love.” Mr. Carter
frowned heavily. “I reckon a man has a right to
pick his own wife, anyway,” he decided finally.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter gave him another mysterious look—a
look that seemed to deplore his ignorance.
Then she rose, murmured something about supper,
and left the room. She was going up the front
stairs, but she heard William coming down, and,
for the first time in her life, she avoided her first-born.
With a feeling of guilty panic, she fled up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the back stairs. She could hear the bride still
moving about in the best parlor chamber, and she
slipped past it and crept softly into Emily’s room.</p>

<p>At the moment her daughter was standing in
front of the looking-glass, staring fixedly into it,
but Mrs. Carter did not notice this. She shut the
door behind her with the air of a conspirator.
Her knees felt weak under her, and she needed
sympathy, the sympathy of her own sex. Of course,
Emily was a child, but she was a girl child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter drew a long breath and put her
finger on her lip. Her astonished daughter viewed
her a moment in alarm; then a look of understanding
dawned in Emily’s eyes, and she stood quite
still, waiting. Mrs. Carter tiptoed across the room
and whispered:</p>

<p>“Emily, do you think she paints her eyes?”</p>

<p>Emily shook her head.</p>

<p>“It’s her eyelashes. I looked hard at ’em,
mama, and she does something to them. They
look thick and soft like feathers. I think they’re
just lovely!”</p>

<p>“Emily!”</p>

<p>“I do! That’s why her eyes look so nice. I’m
going to find out how she does it, too.”</p>

<p>“Emily Carter, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?
I—oh!” Mrs. Carter wiped her eyes. “I’m so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
ashamed—for Willie! My son’s wife with make-believe
eyelashes! It—it isn’t respectable!”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew how she did it,” said Emily.
“Anyway, I’m going to find out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, having dropped into a chair, buried
her face in her handkerchief. She had been longing
for a good cry, and this was her first moment
of real enjoyment. Her comfortable shoulders
rose and fell convulsively, and her daughter
caught the muffled sounds of grief. Emily did not
heed them, but turned again to her mirror. She
had short, blond eyelashes, a good two shades
lighter than her blond hair. She viewed them
now with the cold eye of an unbiased critic.</p>

<p>“Light eyelashes are horrid,” she said to herself
with a glitter of determination in her eye. “I
must find out how she does it.”</p>

<p>“My daughter-in-law!” sobbed Mrs. Carter under
her breath. “My Willie’s wife, and—and she
chalks her nose—I saw it myself!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Carters</span>, after a few days, tried to settle
down and get used to it, but the new Mrs. Carter
never quite let them do it. She kept taking them
by surprise, with a kind of flying grace that left
them speechless. She was making rapid conquests,
too. Leigh had become her slave. He followed
her about in an embarrassed state of subjugation,
and spent long hours in his room writing sonnets,
dedicated to Fanchon, or, more often, to “another’s
wife.”</p>

<p>Emily, meanwhile, was making some curiously
subtle alterations in her own appearance, as yet
undiscovered by her anxious mother. She had
successfully negotiated a loan of three dollars
from Daniel—for purposes unknown.</p>

<p>In one way or another, the bride had made progress
with them all; she had fascinated, or dazzled,
or perplexed first one member of the family and
then another. It was only Daniel, the student and
philosopher, who still resisted. In the rôle of
an observer, he maintained an unruffled tranquillity.</p>

<p>It was this very thing—his inaccessibility, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
aloofness—that ruffled young Mrs. Carter. At
first she had not noticed him—a pale young man
who limped; but after a while she caught herself
watching him, expecting something, she knew not
what. She was tantalized by his silence, his drawling
Southern speech, his quiet observation. In a
hundred little ways she had tried to take him unawares
and failed. Then he grew interesting, and
she studied him. She had that love of conquest
that some women have, and she had not conquered
Daniel.</p>

<p>Quite unaware of the interest he had excited,
Daniel pursued his usual course, except in one direction.
He had had neither the heart nor the
courage to go to the Denbighs. It seemed to him
that he could never bear to see again that look in
Virginia’s eyes, a look that was not for him—and
not caused by him, thank God! It followed him
when he worked in Judge Jessup’s office, on briefs
that were soon to make him famous, and when
he walked, meditating, under the stars. It could
not be shut out, because Virginia’s face, her eyes,
her smile, had been with him so long in secret.</p>

<p>He had tried to thrust the image out when he
thought she was to be his brother’s wife, but now
he did not try to battle with it. He would, indeed,
have loved to dwell upon it, but for that look of
doubt and pain in her eyes when she first heard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
William’s marriage. Love’s vision is excruciatingly
clear when it is looking at love revealed.
He knew now! And he had found it too hard to go
there; he felt as if he had, in some mysterious way,
become heir to his brother’s falsehood. He was
bearing a vicarious punishment by denying himself
a sight of Virginia’s face; but he thought of
her with a constancy that shut out his brother’s
bride.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Virginia one day when he
came in rather earlier than usual, and, finding the
library empty, sat down to write a letter or two.
He chose his place, too, because there was a picture
of Virginia on the mantelpiece—a small photograph
of her as a schoolgirl, which she had given
to his mother. It was framed and standing there
beside the old ormolu clock.</p>

<p>As Daniel wrote he looked up at the picture
with that curious sense of companionship that
lonely people, people who have suffered, draw
from such inanimate images of those they love.
It comforted him. He lit his pipe and began to
write. For the moment he forgot his lameness,
that lameness which seemed to him such an insuperable
barrier to his own hopes of happiness.</p>

<p>The house was quiet. His father and William
had not yet come in, his mother and Emily seemed
to have effaced themselves, and he knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Leigh was taking an examination at school. It was
very peaceful. The old, worn room had a certain
shabby dignity, the company of books looked down
at him, and through the open window he could see
a snow-white lilac in full and splendid bloom. He
halted his pen for a moment, and looked out at
the sunshine that seemed to bathe the delicate
blossoms in a shower of splendor.</p>

<p>He had utterly forgotten the sensation of the
household, his brother’s wife, and he was taken
unawares. The door behind him opened softly,
he perceived the scent of violets, and Fanchon entered.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi.</i>” She stood looking at him, her head
on one side. “I didn’t know you were here!”</p>

<p>Daniel laid down his pen. He had come to expect
something new every time he saw her.</p>

<p>“Does that matter?” he asked, smiling, aware
that she was dressed for the street and that she
looked lovely, a dark, bewitching little creature
with haunting eyes. “I don’t matter. Come in,
do!”</p>

<p>She came, watching him, and put out her hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais non!</i> Let us be friends,” she said softly,
with a kind of childish frankness.</p>

<p>“I thought we were friends already,” he retorted,
touching the hand lightly and flushing in
spite of himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“<i>Non, non</i>, you don’t like me!”</p>

<p>Daniel rose and drew forward a chair.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, <i>madame</i>,” he said gaily. “I forgot
my manners. You see, I’m your brother and
I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>She perched lightly on the arm of the chair,
waving him back to his seat.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” she retorted quickly. “You
don’t like me, <i>monsieur</i>!”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his own chair, watching her,
wondering just what she meant.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re mistaken. Perhaps I do like
you. Why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>She laughed, throwing one arm lightly across the
back of the chair and letting the light flash on the
jewels she wore on her small fingers—extraordinary
jewels, Daniel thought, for William’s wife.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais non</i>, I know! I feel things here!” She
touched her heart lightly, the dark eyes misting
suddenly, the red lips trembling. “I—I can’t live
unless I’m loved!”</p>

<p>“If we all felt like that there’d be a good many
deaths,” Daniel remarked.</p>

<p>For a moment she made no reply, but her face
seemed to grow pale and small and appealing.</p>

<p>“She’s either a creature of a hundred moods,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
he thought musingly, “or she has an extraordinary
facial control.”</p>

<p>Fanchon seemed to feel his thought. His very
attitude, aloof and challenging and critical, affected
her. She shivered, covering her eyes with
her hands.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me like that!” she cried passionately.
“<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I can’t bear it! You—you
hate me!”</p>

<p>Daniel reddened; he found himself in an uncomfortable
position. Had he shown his hostility so
strongly? Had he let this wild young creature see
that he felt she was an interloper?</p>

<p>“You’re talking nonsense, Fanchon,” he said
gravely. “I hate no one—as far as I can remember.
I’m a colorless fellow, you know, and a cripple.
I don’t count.”</p>

<p>She lifted her face from her hands at that and
looked at him again, her dark eyes soft, tender,
almost caressing.</p>

<p>“Why do you think of that so much?” she asked
him kindly. “It hurts you all through to your
soul, I see it! Yet it doesn’t matter—<i>ça ne fait
rien</i>! You’re only a little lame, it is so interesting,
<i>si distingué</i>.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he smiled bitterly. “If you keep
on, Fanchon, I shall have cause to love you in good
earnest. I hate being lame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“I know it!” Her eyes still dwelt on his with
a kind of wild softness—the sylvan, fawn-like look
again. “And I care—see? Yet you can’t like me!
Oh, I know”—she shook her head—“I always
know—because I’ve been unhappy, too.”</p>

<p>“You?” he smiled, this time with amusement.
“You seem to me a thing of thistledown and sunshine,
a sprite, a nymph—anything but unhappy.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands on her knee, looking at
him dreamily.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>mais non</i>, that’s because you don’t know!
I’m an orphan; I had no one—until William
came.” Her face softened, glowed, grew infinitely
tender. “<i>Guillaume de mon cœur!</i> Before that—I
will tell you. <i>Maman</i> died when I was two years
old. She was Irish—she was born in southern
California, but all her people were Irish. She was
poor; she worked in a little inn near a great fruit-grower’s
ranch. <i>Mon père</i>”—Fanchon made a
sudden grimace—“I didn’t like him. You think
that’s wicked? I didn’t love him. He was French
and he made wine upon the ranch. He married
the Irish girl, and I was born.”</p>

<p>She stopped, her chin in her hand, thinking.
Daniel, listening, smiled inwardly. Involuntarily
his eyes lifted to the portrait of the ancestral
Carter.</p>

<p>“Shade of my ancestors!” he thought amusedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
“An Irish waitress and a French wine-maker!”</p>

<p>But Fanchon’s voice, light and sweet and tantalizing,
went on.</p>

<p>“Papa took me to Paris after <i>maman</i> died. He
put me in a convent and left me there. That’s all.
I never saw him again, though he sent money now
and then. At last he died. <i>Voilà!</i>” She clenched
her hands passionately. “No one loved me, no
one cared whether I lived or died except the good
sisters.” She leaned over and laid one hand
lightly on the table, looking at him. “Do you wonder
now—that I’m so wild?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were wild,” Daniel replied,
smiling. “I’m sorry—poor child!”</p>

<p>“No one else was sorry!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think some one else must have been—besides
William,” said Daniel.</p>

<p>She drew her breath quickly, biting her lip. For
a long moment she studied him; then, with a shrug,
she reached for a match on the table and looked at
it, turning it over in her hand.</p>

<p>“I——” She glanced over her shoulder at him,
her eyes veiled by their long lashes. “Please give
me a cigarette,” she pleaded. “William didn’t
want me to frighten your mother. I’m—I’m dying
to smoke!”</p>

<p>Daniel stared, not so much at the request as at
the sudden change. It was as if she had dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a mantle and revealed her true self. The tragedy
and pathos which, a moment before, had made her
so appealing, so childlike, vanished. She sat on
the arm of the chair, a daring little figure, one
hand stretched out, the other holding the match
ready to strike. Her face, too, sharpened, and
seemed to have lost its soft beauty.</p>

<p>There was something keen and reckless about
it, and the darkened lashes and reddened lips gave
it a bizarre effect, almost like a mask.</p>

<p>“Please—a cigarette!” she pleaded.</p>

<p>Daniel thrust his hand into his pocket, produced
his cigarette-case, and held it out.</p>

<p>“Better smoke when mother isn’t on hand,” he
counseled her. “She’s old-fashioned, you know.”</p>

<p>Fanchon drew a long breath of content, lit the
cigarette, and began to smoke. She smoked, daintily,
her eyes changing and the long-fringed lashes
shading them. Gradually, visibly, she relaxed, the
sharpness softened, the eyes grew languorous.</p>

<p>“What heaven!” she said after a moment. “It’s
dreadful, isn’t it, when you’ve always smoked,
and you can’t get it? I—I think I should have
stolen it soon!”</p>

<p>“I see!” Daniel laughed softly. “You should
always smoke, Fanchon. Without it you’re a
prey to sadness, to memories, to imagination. With
a cigarette you’re happy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“<i>Mais non</i>, I’m not happy!” She lifted her
lashes and gave him a fleeting glance. “But it
soothes me. I’m not happy, because”—she rose
and stood looking at him, the cigarette in her
fingers—“because I know you all wanted William
to marry <i>her</i>!”</p>

<p>With one of her sudden, birdlike dives, she
touched the picture of Virginia Denbigh on the
mantel. In spite of himself, Daniel started violently
and colored. An impulse, as sudden and
uncontrollable as her movement, made him spring
to his feet. He wanted to snatch the picture from
her hand; but he restrained himself, lifted his pipe
from the table, and knocked the tobacco out into
his father’s ash-tray.</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?” he asked her quietly,
beginning to refill the pipe.</p>

<p>She laughed, but he saw that the hand which
held Virginia’s picture was trembling. She did
not answer him in words, but turned and looked
at him over her shoulder, her dark eyes glowing
in a face that seemed colorless except for the scarlet
lips. Daniel, aware of the look, avoided it, a
sudden fear in his heart. Something, something
subtle and inexplicable, moved him. With an
effort of self-control—greater than he knew—he
took the picture of Virginia out of her hands and
replaced it on the shelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Why do you think that about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“I know it! I know the kind—<i>jeune fille à
marier</i>! Whenever your mother looks at me in
here, she looks at that picture and sighs. And
your father stares at it and stares at me—comparing
us!” She laughed again, a little wildly.
“<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I know!”</p>

<p>Daniel frowned.</p>

<p>“You let your imagination run away with you,”
he said sharply, returning to his seat and lighting
his pipe.</p>

<p>He wanted to make her feel that she had transgressed
foolishly. He wanted to be a shield for
Virginia Denbigh—wanted it passionately.</p>

<p>Fanchon watched him, her head lowered. She
looked, he thought, like a slender bewitching sorceress
about to work a spell upon him—or upon
Virginia’s picture.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said slowly and softly. “I can’t
make you like me—you’re my enemy!”</p>

<p>Daniel stared, aghast, groping for words. But
she did not wait; she turned, ran out of the room,
and slammed the door behind her. She left Daniel
still staring, half-perplexed, half-amused. He was
angry, too.</p>

<p>“The little whirlwind!” he said below his
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Then he thought of William with a qualm of
pity. Not that he thought that William greatly
deserved it, for Daniel’s heart still flamed with
anger for Virginia Denbigh; but William was
plainly unequal to this—this handful! The observer
of the family, Daniel had already suspected
a rift in the lute. He knew that his brother was
no longer radiantly happy. William had, in fact,
the air of the uneasy keeper of a new leopardess,
not yet broken in to the etiquette of the zoological
park. Daniel had intercepted warning glances,
signs, and murmurs between the two, and he had
seen William’s evident embarrassment when
Fanchon came in contact with his mother.</p>

<p>“He’s been expecting this,” Daniel thought,
and smiled, reaching for his pipe again.</p>

<p>It had gone out twice already, and he began to
coax it. Before he could rekindle it, the door
opened—softly this time—and Mrs. Carter came in
with a pale face and staring eyes. She stopped
tragically just at the threshold.</p>

<p>“Dan, was she <i>smoking</i>?” she gasped out in an
awed undertone.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she was, mother. Why?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter clung to the back of the chair Fanchon
had just vacated.</p>

<p>“I thought so! I—I saw it, Dan! She went out
of the front door of my house—my son’s wife—smoking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> 
a cigarette,” she cried in a climax of
horror.</p>

<p>Daniel tried to stem the tide.</p>

<p>“She’s been educated in Paris, mother. Lots of
women smoke.”</p>

<p>“Not in our set, Dan, and not in the street, anyway!”
Mrs. Carter sank into the chair. “Daniel,
I—I’m mortified to death!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! She’ll stop after a while—when
she finds out you don’t like it. Never mind,
mother, make the best of it. Very likely no one
saw her but you.”</p>

<p>“Saw her!” Mrs. Carter sat up straight and
stared at him. “Do you happen to know who are
talking to William at this very minute, at the end
of this street, just where she’s sure to meet them?”</p>

<p>Daniel laid down his pipe, turning a little pale.</p>

<p>“No,” he said slowly. “Who?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Denbigh and Virginia!”</p>

<p>Her son said nothing, but he turned his eyes
slowly away and looked out of the window at the
white lilac.</p>

<p>“Virginia Denbigh!” wailed Mrs. Carter.
“Think, just think of Virginia smoking!”</p>

<p>And she burst into angry, shamed, helpless
tears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Denbigh</span> and Virginia had arrived at
the corner of the street after a lengthy discussion.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to call,” the colonel had
said thoughtfully, pulling his mustache.</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Virginia. “I’ve called already,
but they were all out.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you manage it that way for me,
Jinny?”</p>

<p>She laughed, blushing furiously.</p>

<p>“I really wanted to see her, grandpa. They say
she’s astonishingly pretty.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I don’t gossip,” the Colonel grinned;
“but Sallie Payson said to me, ‘The bride paints
her face!’”</p>

<p>Virginia looked at him absently, her eyes
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I wonder! I met Emily yesterday. You know
what a blond child she is? She has short, almost
white eyelashes naturally.”</p>

<p>Her grandfather nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, pig lashes—I remember. What about
’em?”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed weakly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“She’s painted them. It gives her the most
singular look. I can’t think her mother knows!”</p>

<p>“She’s at the monkey age. She’s copying Mrs.
William, of course.” He stood a moment, thinking,
his thumbs in his waistcoat, and his fine white
head bent. “It’s too bad! I—I suppose I’ve got
to call, Jinny?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, and he turned his head slowly,
looking at her with a fine reluctance. If she was
distressed, he did not want to see it. But he was
reassured by her face. It was calm; there was
only a little higher color in her cheeks, but her
eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>After a moment she answered him.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you have to go. William’s
such a young man, and I’ve called and left your
card. Perhaps you needn’t—not at once,
grandpa.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want them to think——” he stopped
with his mouth open, he had come very near to
speaking out—“I don’t want to hang back,” he
concluded lamely; “but, confound it, Jinny, I don’t
want to go alone!”</p>

<p>She laughed a little nervously.</p>

<p>“You needn’t. I’ve got to ask her to sing at
the concert on Friday. Emily told me she had a
lovely voice, and it’s got around that she’s a sensation—a
beauty, you know. Mrs. Payson and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Mrs. Barbour made me promise to ask her to sing.
It’s for the Carters’ church, anyway, so of course
it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“You mean that concert to pay the church debt
off?” The colonel looked thoughtful a moment;
then suddenly he guffawed. “Going to ask her to
sing in a Sunday-school hall—before all those
strait-laced people—a girl from Paris? I reckon
I’ll go, Jinny!”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, and pay five dollars for a
front seat. It’s really going to be very good,
grandpa. Caraffi—the pianist, you know—is
going to play. He’s expected Friday morning.
His manager, a man called Corwin, came over to
arrange for it yesterday. I’m very glad that I
don’t have to deal with him again!” she added
with a shudder.</p>

<p>The colonel gave her a quick look.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, for no reason—except that he’s terrible!
A—a person!”</p>

<p>“What sort of a person?”</p>

<p>“Showy. He wears a huge diamond ring and
very sporty clothes. He’s got a perfectly beautiful
mustache and sparkling eyes, and—well, he’s
just terrible!”</p>

<p>“Humph! How about Caraffi, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“That’s different, of course. Caraffi plays exquisitely.
I heard him last year, you know, in
Baltimore. I was so glad when we could get him
to come. It makes us sure of success, and we’ve
all worked hard.”</p>

<p>“You have,” the colonel remarked dryly; then
he rose reluctantly from the old garden-seat where
they had been sitting. “I suppose we might as
well go, Jinny, and get it over.”</p>

<p>“You mean—to call upon Mrs. William
Carter?”</p>

<p>She spoke in a low voice. For the first time
there was a note in it that betrayed the pressure
she was putting on herself. It did not tremble,
but it hurt the colonel’s ear.</p>

<p>He glanced at her quickly, and caught the soft
flush on her downcast face. He thought she had
never looked so pretty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied slowly. “When I’ve got to
have a tooth pulled I like to get it over. Suppose
we go now, Jinny?”</p>

<p>“All right,” she smiled cheerfully. “I’ll ask
her for Friday, and get that over, too. You see,
they put me on the musical committee.”</p>

<p>“Going to play, child?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“After Caraffi? Heaven forbid!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I bet you a dollar you could beat him at it!”
said the colonel with fine loyalty.</p>

<p>His granddaughter laughed, taking his arm affectionately.</p>

<p>They walked down the quiet street thus, his
fine white head towering over hers. The colonel
was a tall old man, and he walked with the
erectness of a soldier. He had run away at sixteen
to be a drummer-boy in Lee’s army, and long
afterward, as loyal to the Union as he had been
active against it in his boyhood, he got his title
in the Spanish war, fighting under General
Wheeler. He had the military bearing still, and he
sometimes saluted when he met one of the old
neighbors trudging past him on the familiar street.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant street, where the quiet houses
stood well back among the trees, and here and
there white-clad figures rocked on the verandas.
The elms arched beautifully overhead, the sunshine
flickering through the close-leafed branches
and falling in a shower of light in the center of
the old, white road. It was peaceful, rural, and
profoundly quiet. Virginia and the colonel, who
loved it, counted six different kinds of birds.</p>

<p>“There’s a black-and-white warbler,” said Virginia.
“Look, grandpa! It’s the first I’ve seen
this year.”</p>

<p>“I love the old cardinal best,” the colonel replied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
“There he is, right on Mrs. Payson’s magnolia.
Hello, Jinny, isn’t that William Carter at
the corner?”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had been looking at the warbler,
started perceptibly. She even put her hand out
quickly and caught at the nearest fence-paling, for
she had long ago dropped the colonel’s arm. This
was the first time she had seen William since his
return, and the shock of it sent the color away
from her face and brought it back with a rush.
She was rosy when she looked around.</p>

<p>“He seems to be alone,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>The colonel nodded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the encounter was inevitable, since
they were moving toward William, and William,
after a moment of almost visible hesitation, was
moving toward them.</p>

<p>“Why, how d’you do, Colonel Denbigh?” said
young Carter nervously. “I—I haven’t seen you
since I came back.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the colonel dryly, shaking hands.
“I live at the same place, though.”</p>

<p>William Carter blushed. He and Virginia
greeted each other silently. She was quite natural
and sweet, but William’s blush deepened. Across
the ocean, under the spell of other emotions and
far different surroundings, it had seemed so easy
to forget home ties—even ties of honor; but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
was not easy here. The very palings in the old
fences seemed to shriek at him.</p>

<p>He remembered painfully the sleepless night
he had spent in Paris after that wild moment when
he forgot himself and asked Fanchon to marry
him. It had been a night haunted with his own
sense of the fine things in life, and he remembered
that—after the tumult had passed—he had had the
sense to burn Virginia’s letters. He could see,
even here, the pile of ashes in the little grate in
his room at the hotel. The ashes of Virginia’s
faithful, cheerful, loving words! He shuddered.</p>

<p>“We were just going to call on your wife,” said
Virginia simply.</p>

<p>As she spoke she raised her clear, untroubled
eyes to his. It seemed as if she wanted to reassure
him by a look—since they could scarcely speak
of it again—that he was forgiven. She wanted
bygones to be bygones.</p>

<p>“Do you think she’s at home?” she added
gently, partly because William seemed incapable
of speech.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I suppose she is.”</p>

<p>He glanced vaguely in the direction of his
father’s house.</p>

<p>The colonel, who was standing, planted firmly
with his feet well apart, and stroking his mustache,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
regarded him with no very friendly gaze.
He saw a violent change come over the young
man’s flushed face. The flush deepened and his
glance toward his home became a fixed and stony
stare. The colonel followed it, discovered the
cause, and stopped pulling his mustache.</p>

<p>Fanchon, emerging from the house in a tempest
of emotion, ran down the garden-path and started
up the street, still smoking Daniel’s cigarette.
She smoked it gracefully, but with the confidence
of long habit. The small figure, too, had an assurance,
a swinging grace, that seemed to differentiate
it from any other figure in the world. There
was a Parisian elegance, too, about her dress, and
she wore a most amazing hat—a coronet of feathers,
flashing red and black, a hat that no one else
could have worn with such astonishing charm and
style. In fact, from the tip of the highest crimson
feather to the end of her tiny shoe, she was
an artistic creation. Two or three passers-by
walked sidewise and one little pickaninny stood
transfixed, in imminent danger of swallowing a
lollypop.</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh coughed.</p>

<p>“Your wife?” he asked William politely.</p>

<p>William, very red, nodded.</p>

<p>“I want you to meet her,” he muttered hastily.
“Just a moment——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>He hurried toward Fanchon. Colonel Denbigh
caught Virginia’s eye and shook silently.</p>

<p>“Gone to capture that cigarette!” he murmured.
“I think I’ll not call to-day.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Virginia, and blushed
again, painfully this time, for her eyes were on the
other two.</p>

<p>William, having met his wife, turned and came
back with her, the sun shining in their faces. They
could be seen much more plainly than they could
see. Fanchon had tossed away her cigarette and
was looking at her husband, with something in the
lift of her small face and the gestures of her
quick, nervous hands, suggesting anger.</p>

<p>“She’s wonderfully pretty,” Virginia thought,
“but a strange little exaggerated creature—and—and
William’s wife!”</p>

<p>She was aware that her own heart was beating
heavily, but she held up her head. Meanwhile
William came up.</p>

<p>“My wife, Colonel Denbigh. Fanchon, this is
Miss Virginia Denbigh. We—we’re old friends,”
he added lamely.</p>

<p>Fanchon looked at them with shining eyes. Her
beauty—a delicate, captivating, elusive kind of
beauty—seemed soft and childlike at the moment.
In spite of the flagrant hat and the flagrantly loud
stockings and the amazing style of dress, she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
dainty, graceful, altogether delightful. And she
wanted to please. She smiled at them softly; she
spoke very little—in a light, hurrying, childish
voice—and she was very deferential, very gentle,
to Colonel Denbigh.</p>

<p>“She’s lovely,” Virginia thought generously.
“I can’t blame him!” Aloud she gave Fanchon
the invitation to sing at the concert. “Caraffi is
to play, so you mustn’t think it’s just an ordinary
concert,” she explained. “We’d be delighted if
you could give us a song—a French song, if you
will.”</p>

<p>Fanchon hesitated, she even blushed, and she
raised her dark eyes to Virginia’s with that peculiarly
engaging wild-fawn look.</p>

<p>“<i>Moi!</i> I’m afraid I don’t sing well enough,”
she said deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“She sings beautifully,” William interposed
eagerly. He was warmed to the heart by her evident
success; he saw that the colonel and Virginia
thought her lovely. “Don’t let her off, Virginia!”</p>

<p>The name slipped out with the sound, so subtle
and yet so unmistakable, that betrays long and
tender intimacy. It slipped out, and William
stopped short, reddening to his hair. It was
not merely calling a beautiful girl by her Christian
name. It was saying a thousand things at once;
and he felt it, like a thrill of electricity, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
through Fanchon. Besides, Virginia blushed, her
eyes meeting his with a sudden appeal, a kind of
silent prayer.</p>

<p>“Please don’t—not in that way!” she seemed
to say.</p>

<p>Fanchon laughed gaily and lightly, looking from
one to the other. Then, with a captivating gesture,
she laid her small fingers on Virginia’s arm.</p>

<p>“<i>Merci du compliment!</i>” she said, sweetly. “I’ll
sing—just one song—for you!”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had recovered her composure in
an instant, smiled back at her.</p>

<p>“That’s all we could hope for, Mrs. Carter. I
can put your name on the program, then—and the
song?”</p>

<p>Fanchon nodded, an elfish look in her eyes now.</p>

<p>“<i>Oui, par example</i>—I can sing anything?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, sing something nice—it’s for the church,
Fanchon!” said William hastily.</p>

<p>“She means something nice,” said Virginia.
“Of course—anything you’ll give us,” she added,
sweetly, drawing away a little.</p>

<p>Evidently she did not quite mean to go back to
the house with them. William saw it—and flushed
again.</p>

<p>“You two were coming to call, weren’t you?”
he asked bluntly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Virginia glanced at her grandfather, and the
colonel shook his head.</p>

<p>“Some other day. It’s”—he looked at his
watch—“it’s near dinner-time now, Jinny.”</p>

<p>She assented, and they drew away graciously.
In spite of that first happy moment when the impression
seemed so good, there was something
wrong. William felt it. He glanced nervously at
his wife, but she was smiling. He had never seen
her look more lovely or less dangerous. He drew
a long breath of relief and urged the Denbighs to
come soon.</p>

<p>“Some evening,” he suggested. “Father will
be delighted to see you, colonel, and Fanchon will
sing for you both.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll surely come soon,” said Virginia.</p>

<p>They managed to get away, and William had an
uneasy feeling as he saw them retreating toward
their home. He was positive that they had been
coming to call. It all embarrassed him. It had
been an ordeal, and he had felt it keenly. He had
always held a good opinion of himself. The successful
eldest son of the family, he had had the
éclat of his success at home; but to-day, face to
face with Virginia, he had felt—he grew hot all
over at the thought of how he had felt.</p>

<p>His wife’s voice startled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Are you going back to the house?” she asked
in an odd tone.</p>

<p>He started, looking at her reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I was. Shall we walk a little way,
instead?”</p>

<p>She shrugged, turning without a word and going
back with him. At another time he would have
thought that there was something strange about
her, but to-day he did not notice. They walked
quite a distance without speaking. The silence
was growing apparent when Fanchon broke it.</p>

<p>“So that’s the girl who’s in love with you!” she
said abruptly.</p>

<p>William reddened.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that!” he exclaimed hastily. “I
never said that!”</p>

<p>She laughed, and he grew angry.</p>

<p>“Listen, Fanchon, I’ve got something to say
to you!”</p>

<p>She gave him a sidelong look.</p>

<p>“<i>Dis donc</i>,” she said.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t smoke on the street.
American girls never do it.”</p>

<p>“Street?” Fanchon looked about her vacantly.
“<i>Ciel</i>, do you call this a street?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. It’s a street in my home town,” replied
William doggedly. “I’m sorry you don’t
like it. We’ve got to live here, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Here?” She looked at him now, her lip
trembling. “<i>Toujours?</i>”</p>

<p>Suddenly she began to laugh, softly at first, and
then wildly, hysterically, dashing tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>William, nonplused, simply stared. He no
longer understood her.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> difficulties of St. Luke’s Church had been
very great. The interest on the debt was heavily
in arrears, and the Ladies’ Association, selected
from the active female members of the congregation,
had labored early and late to find its share
of the money. There had been fairs and tableaux
and even Mrs. Jarley’s waxworks, but none of
these things had done more than collect a tax on
the members of the church. Outsiders had been
absolutely shy, and the members were beginning to
find a hole in both sides of their pockets. They
made dainty articles for sale—splashers and
whiskbroom holders and aprons—and dressed
dolls and baked cakes, and then went to the bazaar
and solemnly bought them back again. It
had become a little wearing on sensitive nerves
and pocketbooks.</p>

<p>Finally, as a brilliant climax, old Mrs. Payson
conceived the idea of a concert that would be fine
enough to coax the reluctant dollars from the Presbyterians
and the Baptists, the Methodists and
the Universalists and the Catholics—in fact, an
entertainment that would draw the town. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Sunday-school hall, a gift from Dr. Barbour’s
father, was large enough to seat almost a theater
audience, and it had a fine platform, furnished with
footlights, and wide enough not only for a grand
piano but for a number of famous singers.</p>

<p>The question of paying the singers had, at first,
staggered the ladies, but Mr. Payson had finally
come to their relief. As the wealthiest member
of the congregation, he usually had to make good
the deficiencies, and he proposed to pay for some
first-class performers if the ladies of the association
would guarantee that they could fill the
hall at good prices—five dollars for the best seats,
two-fifty for the second best, and one dollar and
fifty cents for children. If they sold every seat
at these rates, they could cover the deficit, and
Mr. Payson would escape another and heavier
levy.</p>

<p>It was Virginia Denbigh who finally achieved it.
She had taken hold with the ardor of youth and
the executive ability which Colonel Denbigh proudly
claimed was an attribute of his family. The
thing was done. The pianist, Caraffi, was engaged
and one fine singer, besides a first-rate orchestra
from out of town.</p>

<p>“No one,” said Virginia, “will pay to hear our
own people, even if they play better.”</p>

<p>The wisdom of this diagnosis of the popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
sentiment was demonstrated by the sale of tickets.
As the night drew near, it became apparent that
not a seat would be vacant. The invitation to
young Mrs. William Carter was a brilliant <i>coup</i>.
The town was anxious to see her and to hear her;
the announcement that she would sing—probably
a French ballad—had rushed the last seats up to
a premium. For William Carter’s sudden marriage
abroad had aroused no small amount of
gossip.</p>

<p>The hall began to fill early. Virginia Denbigh,
who had come down with her grandfather, glanced
over it with a thrill of pleasure.</p>

<p>“We’re going to make it,” she said softly,
“every cent! Look, grandpa, they’re selling the
last seats for five dollars—away back, too!”</p>

<p>“Scandalous!” retorted the colonel. “Can’t
see a thing there but the top of Mrs. Payson’s
bonnet, and there’ll be a draft from the door.
You’ve got no conscience, Jinny. Make them sell
those for a dollar.”</p>

<p>She laughed, patting his arm.</p>

<p>“You go and take your seat; I’ve got to be back
in the reception-room to meet the singers.”</p>

<p>The old man nodded, making his way to a front
seat, and looking about him interestedly as he
went.</p>

<p>The congregation was there in force, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
rector and his wife well down in front; but, for the
first time in the history of their church entertainments,
the rest of the townspeople appeared
there, too. Colonel Denbigh counted three ministers
and half a dozen deacons. The black coats
and white neckties were well forward, and there
were three old ladies, patrons of the church, already
seated, with their ear trumpets at their ears.
On the rear benches the young people were congregated,
and, as the hall filled, the young men of
the town stood about in groups in the aisles and
behind the last seats.</p>

<p>But it was a very solemn gathering, after all.</p>

<p>“Sunday-school meeting,” thought the colonel.
“Hard-shelled Baptists and Methodists on one
side, and High-church Episcopalians and Roman
Catholics on the other. Needs something a little
sprightly to make ’em sit up and take notice. I
wonder——”</p>

<p>He looked about him curiously, and then he saw
Mr. Carter going slowly down the aisle, followed
by his wife and Emily.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the colonel. “Didn’t expect such
luck. You’ve got the seat next to me, Mrs. Carter.
How are you, Emily?” He glanced rather sharply
at the girl as he spoke, startled by her unusual appearance,
for Emily’s white eyelashes were now a
dark brown, and her nose was whitened. “Bless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
my soul!” thought the colonel, and then, to Mr.
Carter: “Where’s William and his pretty wife?”</p>

<p>“William isn’t coming,” Mr. Carter replied
shortly, seating himself heavily and feeling of his
necktie. “He’s at home, smoking a pipe with Dan.
His wife”—Mr. Carter glanced at the lighted
platform, filled with a grand piano and many
palms—“I suppose she’s coming. She started
with Leigh half an hour ago. He’s bringing her.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>The colonel tried to think of something more to
say, but Mrs. Payson relieved him. She fluttered
across the aisle.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Carter, we’re all crazy to hear your
new daughter sing! Judge Jessup says she’s got
a lovely voice.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter smiled tremulously and blushed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said faintly, but with some pride in
her voice. “The judge heard her the other night.
She’s—she’s coming with Leigh.”</p>

<p>As she spoke there was a flutter and stir in the
audience, and Mrs. Payson retreated hastily to
a front seat. Judge Jessup had just appeared on
the platform with a tall, thin man who wore an
immaculate dress-suit and displayed an amazing
head of black hair.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said the judge in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
deep bass, “it’s my duty and my pleasure to introduce
the great pianist, Signor Caraffi.”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh led the applause, and for a
moment it was deafening. The pianist, thrusting
one hand in the front of his white satin waistcoat,
bowed low. Judge Jessup discreetly withdrew
into the shadow of the palms where—at intervals—the
audience glimpsed white skirts and pink
skirts and blue skirts, and two or three amazing
pairs of feet skirmishing behind the foliage and
between the substantial green tubs. But even
these things became less diverting when the hirsute
gentleman began to play.</p>

<p>“Oh, how wonderful!” breathed Mrs. Carter
with relief.</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh nodded.</p>

<p>“Looks like a hair-restorer advertisement,” he
replied gently; “but he can play. I reckon it’s
genius that makes his hair grow!”</p>

<p>It certainly looked like genius, for he was really
a great pianist. For a while he held the audience
spellbound. Splendid music filled their ears and,
in some cases at least, stirred their souls. Even
the more frivolous listeners forgot to make fun
of the huge, shaggy head as it bent and swayed
and nodded while the pianist forgot himself and
forgot the world in his conflict with the instrument—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
conflict that always left him supremely
master of heavenly harmonies.</p>

<p>Back in the little room behind the platform, Virginia
listened and forgot that she was worn out
with superintending it all; forgot that she still
had her anxieties, and would have them until the
last number was successfully rendered, for Mrs.
William Carter was next on the bill, and Mrs.
Carter had not come. Not yet! Virginia was
waiting for her, much against her will, for there
were two or three operatic strangers waiting also,
and that intolerable man Corwin, Caraffi’s manager.</p>

<p>Virginia was aware of him, aware of his sleek
good looks and his watchful eyes. Finding them
fixed in her direction, she turned her shoulder toward
him, and was thus the first to see the arrival
of Fanchon and Leigh. They came in softly,
Fanchon on tiptoe, listening to Caraffi, and Leigh
laden with her wraps and her music-roll, his
young, flushed face turned adoringly toward his
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Virginia could not blame him. It seemed to her
that the girl—she looked no more than seventeen
or eighteen—was wonderfully pretty. For Fanchon
had stopped just inside the door, where the
light fell full upon her, and was listening, her
head a little bent and her finger on her lips. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
had given her wrap to Leigh, and stood there, a
shining little figure, in white and silver, much
<i>décolleté</i>, her slender arms and her lovely young
throat unornamented. Her gown—a Parisian
thing, Virginia thought—clung to her in a wonderful
way, like the shining calyx of a flower; and
yet it floated, too, when she moved. Her dusky
hair, her wonderful dark eyes, and the piquant
little face, needed no better frame than the glimpse
of starry night in the open door behind her and
the glimmer of shaded lights overhead.</p>

<p>Virginia went forward.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you’ve come,” she said softly.
“Your number is the next one, Mrs. Carter.”</p>

<p>Fanchon turned to answer, putting out a small,
bejeweled hand, confident and smiling, a sparkling
little creature. Then suddenly there came a
change. She stopped short and stood motionless.
She scarcely seemed to breathe. It was as if some
force stronger than her will had arrested her.</p>

<p>Watching her face, Virginia felt the shock of it,
without knowing what it was—fear or hate, or a
mingling of both. But Fanchon’s eyes were fixed
on Corwin, and they were no longer soft. It was
not the look of a wild fawn, but of a tigress at
bay. Something within, some feeling as strong as
it was extraordinary, transformed her. For an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
instant she seemed to flinch, then she stood facing
him.</p>

<p>The man, turning as suddenly, saw her. He
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Fanchon la Fare!” he exclaimed, and came toward
her, speaking rapidly in French.</p>

<p>Virginia turned away. She did not want to listen,
but she heard an exclamation from Fanchon,
and saw her leave Corwin standing, an odd look
on his face.</p>

<p>Leigh, who had been busy with the wraps,
turned, saw the meeting and Fanchon’s face. He
dropped his burden and crossed over to her
quickly.</p>

<p>“What did he say to you, Fanchon?” he panted.
“If he was rude to you, I’ll—I’ll thrash him!”</p>

<p>Fanchon laughed a wild little laugh.</p>

<p>“Dear boy!” she said softly, and stroked his
hand. “<i>Je t’adore!</i>”</p>

<p>Leigh flushed, his lowering gaze fastened angrily
on Corwin, and Virginia drew a breath of relief
when she heard the applause outside. Caraffi had
given them a cheery encore; he was coming off
the platform, and Fanchon must go on. Virginia
called to her softly.</p>

<p>“Now, please, Mrs. Carter!” she said.</p>

<p>Fanchon turned and looked at her, saw by her
face that Virginia had seen too much, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
eyes blazed with anger. She took a step forward
and snatched up her music-roll, running
her fingers over the leaves and biting her lip.</p>

<p>“Tell them to play this, please,” she said, with
her head up.</p>

<p>Without looking at it, Virginia took it to the director
of the orchestra, glad to escape the little
scene. It seemed to her that the air was charged,
and she knew that the wait had been too long
already. She could hear the impatient stir outside.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, a little stir of impatience in
the hall. Two or three young ushers went up and
down the aisles with pitchers of iced water, and
the rear seats began to fill up with gentlemen who
were eating cloves. The rest of the audience
studied the program, expectant. “No. 2, Mrs.
William Carter, solo,” appeared on it in fine type.</p>

<p>“My daughter-in-law’s going to sing next,”
said Mr. Carter, remembering the broken engagement
and putting out a feeler. “Seen her yet,
colonel?”</p>

<p>“Saw her the other day.” The colonel clasped
the top of his cane, leaning on it, and looking absently
at an amazing pair of feet and ankles that
he saw approaching from behind the palms.
“She’s mighty pretty.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” Mr. Carter smiled. “Notice her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
eyes? Something fawn-like about them—and velvety.
We’ve got to calling her—among ourselves,
of course—‘the wild fawn.’”</p>

<p>At this moment one of the old ladies behind
them interrupted. She tapped Mr. Carter’s shoulder
with her fan.</p>

<p>“I do like music,” she said in a loud whisper.
“It’s so churchy. I can’t hear much, but I feel
it down my spine. Now, tableaux—well, sometimes
they’re not just the thing, but music for the
church, it’s—it’s safe!”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh, overhearing, pulled his mustache.
His ear had caught the first notes of a
piece that was not “churchy”; it was far too light
and too fantastic.</p>

<p>“The kind of tune that makes a fellow sit up
and take notice,” the colonel thought. “I
wonder——”</p>

<p>He got no farther before he was drowned in applause.
A small, graceful, shimmering figure had
slipped out from behind the palms. Fanchon stood
in the center of the stage, her slender arms raised
and her hands clasped behind her head, her eyes
bent downward, the shadowy hair framing a low,
white brow, her red lips slightly parted. If she
heard the applause, she did not heed it. She made
no response; she only waited.</p>

<p>Then, as the soft, seductive strains began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
fill the hall with music, she began to sing—softly
at first, then rising note by note until her clear
soprano floated upward like the song of a bird.
Then, just as the tension seemed to relax and a
deep sigh of pleasure came from the most anxious
of the audience, she began to dance.</p>

<p>Still singing, she danced wonderfully, strangely,
wildly. Her skirt, clinging and shimmering and
floating at the edges, clung to her. It unfolded like
a flower as she stepped, and folded again about
her slender ankles, above the marvel of her dancing
feet. She swayed lightly from side to side,
her slender body the very embodiment of grace
and motion, as her dancing seemed to be the interpretation
of the music, subtle, seductive, wonderful.
So might the daughter of Herodias have
danced before Herod Antipas!</p>

<p>Breathless, the good people in the front rows
stared. Movement was impossible, every sense
seemed suspended, everything but the sensation
of amazement. Mrs. Carter looked in a frightened
way at her husband and caught the twinkle in
Colonel Denbigh’s eye. Then she saw her rector
mop his forehead with his handkerchief, and she
raised her shamed eyes to the stage. Fanchon
was pirouetting on one toe! Applause had started
in the back rows, among the black sheep, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
running down the side aisles like a prairie-fire
when Mr. Carter abruptly rose.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said roughly to Colonel Denbigh
as he clambered over him. “I—I’ve forgotten
something!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter half rose and then sank back, pulled
down by Emily, but she seemed to hear, through
the spluttering applause, her husband’s crashing
exit.</p>

<p>It might be said that Mr. Carter had the effect
of a stone thrown from an ancient catapult, he
went with such bounds and rushes. For a stout
man his performance was little short of miraculous.
He covered the distance to his own door in
ten minutes, got out his latch-key, found the key-hole
unerringly in the dark, went in, and banged
the door to with a violence that made the ornaments
on the hall mantel rattle.</p>

<p>The hall was vacant, but he saw a stream of
light coming out of the library, and headed violently
for it. William was alone, huddled in an
easy chair, smoking and reading. Mr. Carter
came in and shut the door. Then he advanced on
his son with a face of thunder.</p>

<p>“William Henry Carter,” said he, “you’ve married
a dancer—a French dancer!”</p>

<p>William, overtaken by the unexpected, laid
down his book and stared. But his father only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
roared the louder. He seemed to think that his
son had grown suddenly deaf.</p>

<p>“Do you hear me, sir?” he bellowed fiercely.
“You’ve married a—a dyed-in-the-wool ballet-dancer!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an hour later when Miranda, looking
very dark and showing the whites of her eyes to
an alarming extent, opened the front door for
Mrs. Carter, Emily and Leigh.</p>

<p>“Mist’ Carter says, please, ma’am, yo’ come
inter de libr’ry,” said the colored servitress in a
sympathetic undertone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter cast an apprehensive look at her
daughter.</p>

<p>“I guess you two had better go up-stairs,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>Emily nodded, and started for the staircase, but
Mr. Carter shouted from the library:</p>

<p>“I hear you-all out there—come in here!”</p>

<p>They went. Leigh, having forgotten to put
down Fanchon’s extra wraps, brought up the rear,
his flushed face just appearing above a mass of
chiffon, lace and fur.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, striding up and down the room
alone, caught sight of his youngest son first.</p>

<p>“Put down those things!” he shouted. “You
look like a dromedary.”</p>

<p>Leigh obeyed, but he straightened himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
stood, sullenly, his eyes on the ground. His
father took no further notice of him.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know if any of you knew what that
girl was going to do to-night?” he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter sank weakly into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t! Wasn’t it awful? I was so
mortified. The Baptist minister went out just
after you, Johnson, and the rector was as red as
could be. I’m sure I don’t know what he
thought!”</p>

<p>“Thought! Where is she?”</p>

<p>“William came for her, and took her out to
supper at the inn,” said Emily in a weak voice.</p>

<p>Like Leigh she stood back, unsympathetic, but
she was a little frightened, too.</p>

<p>“Humph! Took her out to supper, eh?” Mr.
Carter thundered. “I reckon he thought he’d better!
I gave him a piece of my mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! He was as white as a sheet.” William’s
mother pressed her handkerchief against
her shaking lips. “He didn’t know, of course.
He wasn’t to blame, dear—you shouldn’t have
done it!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t to blame?” Mr. Carter blazed with
wrath. “Didn’t he marry that ballet-dancer?
Didn’t he bring a French ballet-dancer home here
and foist her on a decent, respectable family? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
wasn’t to blame, you say? By Jove, I wish he was
small enough to thrash!”</p>

<p>He was still walking up and down. As he swung
around, Leigh faced him.</p>

<p>“She’s a lovely creature!” the boy cried passionately.
“That dance was beautiful—everybody
thought so!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Leigh!” gasped his mother. “Dr. Fanshawe
was ashamed to look at it!”</p>

<p>“Old idiot!” cried Leigh. “You’re all making
her unhappy—any one can see it. Nothing but
criticism from morning until night—I call it
cruel!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter stared at him a moment in amazed
incredulity. Then he jeered.</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” he cried. “Wisdom from the
mouths of babes and sucklings! Do you want to
marry a ballet-dancer, too, sir?”</p>

<p>But his son’s blood was up.</p>

<p>“I call it a burning shame!” he cried. “She’s
come here, a foreigner, and she wants to love us,
and you’re talking brutally about her. She’s exquisite,
she was to-night, she——”</p>

<p>“Go to bed!” shouted Mr. Carter. “Shut up
and go to bed!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rose hastily and gave Leigh a little
shove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Go!” she whispered. “There, there—don’t
aggravate papa.”</p>

<p>Leigh, shaking with anger, yielded ground reluctantly.</p>

<p>“She’s an angel!” he shouted at the door. “I
won’t have her abused!”</p>

<p>“Did you marry her!” Mr. Carter asked with
fine sarcasm. “Maybe I’ve made a mistake; I
thought it was William.”</p>

<p>Leigh almost choked with indignation.</p>

<p>“He isn’t here—I won’t have her talked about.”</p>

<p>“Go to bed!” thundered Mr. Carter, taking a
step forward.</p>

<p>“I——” Leigh began to sputter again, but his
mother thrust him out and shut the door.</p>

<p>“Do speak lower, Johnson,” she sobbed. “I
know Miranda listens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a hang whether Miranda listens
or not,” said Mr. Carter. “That boy’s an ass—talk
about his being a genius!”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, he’s only eighteen,” said Mrs. Carter
deprecatingly, “and she’s made up to him
from the very first.”</p>

<p>“He’s an ass!” repeated Mr. Carter. “And I
guess the whole town knows I’ve got a ballet-dancer——”</p>

<p>He stopped; his eye had suddenly lighted on
Emily. She was huddled in a frightened attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
behind her mother’s chair, and the light was
strong on her face. Her father stared.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that child’s eyes?” he
demanded suddenly. “They look like burnt holes
in a blanket!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, following his look, suddenly noticed
her daughter’s eyelashes and nose. In an illuminating
flash she remembered that first night in
Emily’s room.</p>

<p>“Oh, Emmy!” she gasped. “You’ve painted
your eyelashes!”</p>

<p>Emily clung to the back of her chair.</p>

<p>“I had to, mama. They’re horrid and white.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, that minx is teaching my daughter
to paint her face! Mama, you ought to be ashamed
of yourself. Can’t you watch your own children?”
bellowed Mr. Carter, beside himself.</p>

<p>“Emmy, I’m ashamed!” Poor Mrs. Carter sat
gasping, her mouth open. “I never dreamed—what’s
that on your nose?”</p>

<p>Emily seized her handkerchief and began to
rub the offending feature.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, mama—just a little liquid
powder.”</p>

<p>“You march up-stairs and wash your face!”
said her father. “Hear me? Don’t let me catch
you painting up like that—singing doll!”</p>

<p>Emily began to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“It’s—it’s nothing, papa. Everybody does it.
The girls think I look so nice.”</p>

<p>“Wash your face!” shouted her father. “March
up and wash your face!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to!” sobbed Emily. “The girls
say my eyes look twice as——”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter seized her by the shoulder and
turned her toward the door.</p>

<p>“Want me to wash your face?” he asked her
grimly. “No? I thought not. Well, then, you
march!”</p>

<p>Emily, sobbing loudly, marched. They could
hear her stumbling up-stairs, crying as she went.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, you were awful!” Mrs. Carter wiped
her own eyes. “The poor child!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that I’m going to let my
daughter paint her face?” Mr. Carter fairly bellowed.
“I reckon I’ve got enough in a daughter-in-law!
I’ll see to Emmy myself, if you can’t!”</p>

<p>“Johnson, you know I didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter emitted another roar, and finally
threw himself into a chair and thrust his feet out.</p>

<p>“What did that fool William do?”</p>

<p>“You mean to-night?” Mrs. Carter dried her
eyes. “He just met us at the door. He was so
white he scared me, and he took Fanchon off in
a taxi—in that scandalous dress! Said he’d give
her a supper out to-night. I’m afraid you’ve done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
it this time, Johnson. What did you do to the
poor boy?”</p>

<p>“Poor donkey! I told him what I thought of
that woman—called by my name, too—a woman
dressing like one of those yellow East Indian
dancing-girls—that’s what I told him.”</p>

<p>“Johnson!”</p>

<p>“I did! What do you s’pose the congregation
thought? By George, it made me hot all over.
Did you see her legs?”</p>

<p>“You mean her stockings? They were a little
startling. I told her so before we started.”</p>

<p>“Startling? My word.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter relapsed into a terrible silence. Mrs.
Carter sat helplessly looking at him. She was
thinking of that dance, that terrible, amazing, dazzling
dance. What a pretty creature, too! That
was it; she had turned William’s head; and
Leigh’s and Emily’s, too. Those painted eyelashes!
For a moment Mrs. Carter half laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s funny—I can’t help it, Johnson,” she said,
feebly apologetic, as she met his irate eyes. “I
was thinking of Emmy trying to paint her lashes.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think it’s funny,” he retorted
hoarsely. “Don’t see the joke myself. I’ve got
too much daughter-in-law, that’s my trouble!”</p>

<p>“Hush! There’s some one now—they’ve come!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Mrs. Carter tiptoed to the door and listened, coming
back, relieved. “No, it’s only Dan.”</p>

<p>“I wish William had Dan’s sense!”</p>

<p>“I wish Dan would marry a nice home girl. It
would make things better,” sighed Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>“Daniel marry?” Mr. Carter raised his voice
again to a roar of discontent and hopelessness.
“Who d’you think Dan could marry? What kind
of a girl d’you think would pick a cripple?”</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, very pale, rose and shut the door;
but she was too late. Daniel, suspecting the trouble
in the library, had started for his own room. The
stairs were just outside the library door, however,
and he could not help hearing every word his
father said. In fact, Mr. Carter’s irate voice rang
out like a trumpet. “What kind of a girl d’you
think would pick a cripple?”</p>

<p>Daniel, clinging to the banisters, ascended more
wearily than usual. The stairs turned at the landing,
and he was out of sight when his mother shut
the door. He never used a cane in the house now.
He was well enough to get along with a heavy limp,
and he made no noise as he crossed the upper hall
and went into his own room. Once there, he locked
his door, and, crossing to the window, stood staring
out with absorbed and thoughtful eyes.</p>

<p>The night was perfect. A young moon had set,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and there seemed to be, instead, a myriad of stars.
He could discern, too, even in the darkness, the
darker profile of the hills, and, nearer at hand,
the clustering beauty of foliage, pierced here and
there with the lights of near-by houses, which
shone in the darkness, without any discernible
outlines behind them, like fallen stars. The air
was fragrant and soft, with the sweetness of
flowering grapes, familiar and homelike, amid all
that blended early blossoming.</p>

<p>He could hear soft, blurred sounds, too—the
hum of insect life, the piping of frogs, the murmur
of the brook that flowed not a hundred yards away.
He stood motionless, thinking, and glad of the cool
night air on his hot cheeks and brow. He felt
as if some one had dealt him a physical blow, and
his bruised flesh was still quivering under it.</p>

<p>“What kind of a girl d’you think would pick a
cripple?”</p>

<p>Daniel shut his lips sharply over his clenched
teeth. It wasn’t a new idea; it wasn’t even a suggestion.
He had known it all along, he told himself,
and yet the bare words were brutal. They
seemed to brand him like hot iron, to shrivel into
his shrinking flesh and leave the mark there.</p>

<p>“Cripple!” He remembered, in a flash, his well
days—the days when he was like other boys, before
the fall which lamed him. He remembered his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
own young scorn of the weakling and the maimed,
the repugnance that the physically strong often
feel toward the physically disabled. Yet there
was nothing disfiguring in his trouble. He was
lame, but he was not twisted; he only halted in
his walk. But, none the less, he was a cripple.</p>

<p>“What kind of a girl d’you think would pick a
cripple?”</p>

<p>Daniel stared steadily out into the night, as if
the starry darkness held the answer. One by one
he saw the lights go out in the houses near at
hand. Farther off, lights still shone in the town
but darkness grew and grew. Then, far off, he
detected a moving thing, saw a leap of flame and
sparks as the smoke belched from the funnel of
the engine. He could trace it coming nearer and
nearer, and then he heard the clamor of its bell
at the crossing, strangely distinct at night.</p>

<p>He turned slowly away, lit the lamp on his table,
and, going to his desk, took out the picture of Virginia
that he had stolen from the mantel down-stairs
after Fanchon’s attack upon it. He brought
it to the table, and, setting it down beside him, began
to write. From time to time, as he wrote, he
glanced up at the young face in the frame, and
felt an exquisite sense of companionship. He was
not alone; the picture kept him company. The
pallor of his face, too, gradually changed, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
slight color rose in his cheeks. He took off his
coat and lit his pipe. Well into the small hours he
worked steadily on a case for Judge Jessup.</p>

<p>He was aware of doors shutting below, aware
that sounds gradually ceased and sleep drenched
the household, but he worked on with the passionate
zeal that only an ambitious man can feel—a
man who has no other end in life but to forget
himself in the fury of his toil. Yet, all the while,
the young face of Virginia bore him mute company,
and sometimes it seemed to smile upon him.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the fury of his thirst for work
slaked, he lifted a haggard face to the light,
glanced at the picture, and stretching his arms
across the table laid his head upon them with a
groan. He fell asleep there from sheer exhaustion
and was sleeping when the sun rose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">William Carter</span> took his wife to the inn for
supper. He had appeared at the door of the Sunday-school
hall with a taxi and abruptly bundled
Fanchon into it. It was just after her performance
on the stage and before the audience began to
disperse. In fact, they heard the strains of some
very churchy music coming from the orchestra,
as if an effort was being made—delayed but strenuous—to
soothe the startled spectators of Fanchon’s
amazing dance.</p>

<p>William said nothing. He sat in the dark interior
of the taxi with a face as white as paper,
and Fanchon, watching him covertly, saw that the
hand he laid on the window shook. She leaned
back in her corner, twisting a strand of pearls
around her throat—a strand that she had put on
after the dance—and watching him; but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>She had danced so wildly, indeed, that she was
still panting and throbbing with excitement. She
seemed to feel the thrill of the music even in her
feet. It was intoxicating, it was what she loved—the
glamour of the lights, the music, the motion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Her whole body vibrated, she could scarcely sit
still, her feet still moved restlessly. She loved it!</p>

<p>Yet she felt that heavy silence of her husband,
the stiffness of his body as he sat there, and she
had caught a glimpse of his ghastly face. She bit
her lips, staring out into the night, her bosom
heaving passionately. She felt like a beautiful
wild bird in a trap.</p>

<p>She stared, too, at the quiet street, with inveterate
dislike of its quietness. She saw the
group of loungers in front of the chemist’s, the
belated pedestrians at the crossing. There was
a glimpse of shadowing trees. Pendent branches
swept and swayed before feebly lighted show-windows,
where the shades were partly drawn down,
and the infrequent street-lamps shot occasional
lances of light across their dingy way. One such
shaft struck on William’s profile and revealed his
tightened lips.</p>

<p>Fanchon wondered. She had not been aware of
Mr. Carter’s catapultic exit, and she did not know
how much her husband knew. Some one must have
telephoned him—whom, she could not conjecture.
She shrank away from him a little, thinking, and
Corwin’s face rose before her mind’s eye. She
saw again the confidence of his smiling, mocking
eyes, and she shuddered.</p>

<p>William seemed to feel it and gave her a quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
look, but said nothing. The taxi had stopped in
front of an old-fashioned inn. It was a long, low
building with a glassed-in dining-room, built to
accommodate the stream of motorists who had
begun to tour the mountains and scatter gold and
gasoline in their wake.</p>

<p>Into the new dining-room—a plain, bare place
with rows of white-covered tables and a few lean
palms on pedestals—William conducted his wife.
Half a dozen negro waiters came forward. He selected
one he knew, chose a remote table, and gave
his order for supper.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want wine?” he said shortly to
Fanchon—almost the first words he had addressed
to her.</p>

<p>She shrugged, slipping off her wraps and amazing
the other diners with the marvels of her costume.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais non</i>,” she replied indifferently. “I’m
heated; I never drink wine when I have danced.”</p>

<p>William, who was giving his order, stopped
short a moment, his eyes down, and she saw him
pant like a man short of breath. But in another
moment he had despatched the waiter with his
order and drained his glass of water.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” said Fanchon, watching him with
dark, mysterious, brooding eyes. “How can you?
Iced water—it’s bad for your liver!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Drat my liver!” said William hoarsely. Then
he leaned across the table, his eyes raised to hers
at last and spoke in a low, even voice for her ears
alone. “What have you been doing, Fanchon?”</p>

<p>She had never seen that look in his eyes before,
and the blood rushed back to her heart. She could
not answer for a moment; her lips moved without
words.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” he repeated sternly. “What
have you been doing to-night?”</p>

<p>“I sang, you know I sang,” she replied at last,
but her eyes quivered and shrank away from his,
and there was something about her like a child expecting
a blow.</p>

<p>But William did not heed it; he was still white
with passion.</p>

<p>“You did more than sing,” he rejoined coldly.
“You danced me into an insult!”</p>

<p>Her eyes dilated.</p>

<p>“An insult—you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an insult. Father saw you. He came
home and told me what he thought of you, and of
me for letting you do it!”</p>

<p>Fanchon put her hand to her throat. She felt
choked again, but her beautiful, wild, fawn-like
eyes clung to his face.</p>

<p>“You danced,” he went on bitterly. “What did
you dance? One of those—those fandangoes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Her face changed; a glimmer of light, of mischief,
shot across it, and she let her jeweled hands
drop in her lap.</p>

<p>“<i>Oui</i>, I danced! <i>Mais que voulez vous?</i> Am
I not a dancer? You—it is you who are ashamed,
<i>mon ami</i>!” she added bitterly. “Why you marry
me, then?”</p>

<p>He threw himself back in his chair, his clenched
hand falling on the table with a gesture as poignant
as it was desperate.</p>

<p>“You’ve let the cat out of the bag! This place—these
provincials! Why, this place is full of it
by now. Did you think you were in Paris?”</p>

<p>“In Paris?” she laughed wildly. “<i>Mon Dieu,
non! ‘O Paris, c’est chez toi qu’il est doux de
vivre, c’est chez toi que je veux mourir!’</i>”</p>

<p>“Drop that chatter!” he said harshly. “You
speak English as well as I do.”</p>

<p>She did not answer for a moment; then she
leaned across the table, looking at him, her face
white and her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“You’re ashamed that you married me, a dancer—<i>n’est-ce-pas</i>?”</p>

<p>He averted his face. She caught only the haggard
whiteness of the profile, and she saw his
hand, stretched on the table, clench and unclench
nervously. She drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“You’re ashamed of me,” she said in a low,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
quivering voice, recoiling from him. “I—I see
it!”</p>

<p>“I loved you,” said William passionately. “I
loved you, I asked you to consider me, and—you
do this!”</p>

<p>“You loved me!” she repeated the words
slowly. “You—<i>loved</i>—me!”</p>

<p>She let the accent fall on the past tense, but he
was deaf to the implied appeal.</p>

<p>“Fanchon, you knew what they’d think of it
here—you must have known. Why did you do it?”
he cried impatiently. “It’s like your cigarette in
the streets—you like to do these things!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mais oui</i>, I like to do them!” she replied softly.
She laughed lightly. “I’m naughty, William,
but”—she leaned toward him again, looking at
him with her fawn-like eyes—“I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>Her look, her voice, her very attitude expressed
surrender, and the softness of her tone appeased
him. He turned his head reluctantly and looked
at her. The light was behind her, making a nimbus
behind her lovely head, her soft, dark hair,
and her white forehead, and the beauty of her
eyes. Her dress, too, the dancer’s silky, shimmering,
clinging robe, seemed to reveal just
enough of her white neck and arms. She was a
thing so young, so exquisite, and so subtly charming
that he caught his breath. She looked as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
had looked the first time he saw her, when he lost
his heart and his head. Her dark eyes clung to
his. “<i>Et toi?</i>” she murmured softly, exquisitely,
her lips trembling a little.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he put out his hand and touched
hers as it lay on the table, and the tenderness of
that touch was a caress. For the moment he forgot
his father and his own anger. She was bewitching,
and she was his own! What did it matter if
these narrow-minded provincials were shocked at
her dancing?</p>

<p>Yet he was aware that while she accepted his
caress, accepted his forgiveness, and gave him a
soft and caressing smile, she was changed. Something
had come between them—something so
subtle, so immaterial, that he could not grasp it;
but he felt ill at ease. He said nothing, he did not
know what to say, he felt that the grievance was
honestly his, and yet, in some mysterious, unfathomable
way, she had put him in the wrong.</p>

<p>He laughed uneasily and began to move the
glasses about awkwardly, jingling the ice in them
like a child. He was glad, too, that the waiter returned
at that moment, with the supper. He
changed his order again and called for wine.</p>

<p>“I’m tired,” he explained to Fanchon. “I feel
as if I needed it.”</p>

<p>She shrugged, elevating her brows and glancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
around the room, aware that necks were craned
here and there, and that some newcomers were
staring steadily at her. One of them—a short,
stout, bald-headed man in a dress-suit with a wide
expanse of shirt-front—kept gazing at her, and
after a while at William. He gazed and rubbed
the top of his bald head, and then ate—taking
large mouthfuls and gulping them down—while he
still gazed at her.</p>

<p>Fanchon, seeing it, looked demurely at her plate,
toying with her fork. She wanted to laugh, but
she remembered her husband’s horror of the sensation
she had just made, and she was aware,
too, of another figure farther away. She flushed
a little, saying nothing, and William, still feeling
that little rift in the lute, busied himself filling
his wine-glass again.</p>

<p>Fanchon, who had never seen him drink wine,
lifted her heavy eyes from her plate to watch him.
She knew he had already filled his glass four times.</p>

<p>“He’s not a drinking man,” she thought
shrewdly. “He’s unhappy because he’s married
me, a dancer!”</p>

<p>William lifted his fifth glass slowly to his lips.</p>

<p>“It’s not bad wine, Fanchon,” he said lightly;
“but we had better in Paris.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“In Paris you didn’t drink wine, <i>mon ami</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>He reddened.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I? I——” He stopped short.</p>

<p>The stout, bald-headed gentleman had risen
abruptly from his table and was approaching
theirs. He did not look at William, but bowed to
Fanchon.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carter, I believe?” he said suavely.
“Mrs. William Carter?”</p>

<p>Fanchon smiled.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais oui</i>, and—Mr. William Carter,” she
added archly, looking at the astonished William.</p>

<p>The fat man bowed again, then he produced a
card-case and laid his card on the table.</p>

<p>“I’m Samuel Bernstein,” he said proudly,
“president of the Unlimited Film Company. Perhaps
you’ve heard of me, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“No!” said William shortly, frowning. “I
haven’t had the pleasure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein gave him a pitying glance.</p>

<p>“Go to the movies?” he asked mildly.</p>

<p>William nodded.</p>

<p>“Sometimes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein elevated his brows. He looked
at Fanchon, and his face changed and glowed
with appreciation.</p>

<p>“Guess you go, madam,” he said in a confident
tone, “a lady of your talent! Excuse me”—he
bowed first to one and then the other—“if you’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
permit me, I’ll sit down. I’ve got a word to say—business,
you know, strictly business.”</p>

<p>Fanchon’s eyes danced. She threw a mocking
look at William’s stiffening face.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Bernstein,” she said sweetly.
“<i>Voilà!</i> I love the movies!”</p>

<p>“There!” Bernstein beamed, drawing up a
chair. “I knew a lady of your talent must love
’em.” He waved his hand gracefully, speaking
to William now, but including William’s wife.
“I want to say, sir, that I witnessed that dance
to-night, and—well, sir, it hit me straight in the
bull’s-eye! Never saw it better done—never! I
congratulate Mrs. Carter, sir, and I congratulate
you. It was a gem!”</p>

<p>William, very red, inclined his head stiffly, but
Fanchon was radiant with smiles.</p>

<p>“<i>Merci du compliment!</i>” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, you’re French, ain’t you?” Mr.
Bernstein returned her smile genially. “Corwin
was telling me you were Mamselle Fonchon lay
Fare. That would sound a top-liner, too, on a
bill-board. Corwin—you know him? Yes? Well,
he’s running a vaudeville show somewhere now,
besides that hairy piano man, and he wants you
in his show. I suspicioned that right off.”</p>

<p>“My wife isn’t a show-woman!” thundered
William, his brow black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“No offense, no offense, Mr. Carter!” Mr.
Bernstein waved a fat hand on which a diamond
flashed magnificently. “I don’t cotton to these
cheap shows myself. Now, madam, I’m a business
man, and I’ve got a proposition to make to
you, a gilt-edged proposition.” He edged his
chair nearer, looking from Fanchon to William
and back again, with the air of a benefactor. “It’ll
appeal to you, sir. It’s dignified, it’s fine, and
it’s money, sir, good money! Now, I saw that
dance to-night and I says to myself, ‘Sammy
Bernstein, if you’re a man you’ll beat it after
that first thing,’ and I’m beating it. Madam,
I’d offer you, as a starter, five hundred dollars
a week to give that dance in a picture, a high-class,
six-reel picture, for the Unlimited Film
Company!” Mr. Bernstein flung himself back in
his chair, thrust his thumbs into the armholes of
his white waistcoat, and beamed upon them.
“Five hundred dollars a week, madam, and your
expenses—for one picture. You can’t beat that—Corwin
ain’t going to beat that!”</p>

<p>“My wife won’t go into the movies!” said William,
white with anger.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein reddened.</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t understand, sir. The Unlimited
Film Company is a star company, sir; it
does the finest pictures in the country; we’ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
more stars than any other company this side of
the Rockies. We got ’em, and we treat ’em right.”</p>

<p>William rose furiously.</p>

<p>“My wife isn’t looking for an engagement, sir,
so we bid you good evening!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein rose hastily.</p>

<p>“I say—no offense——”</p>

<p>“You’re very good,” said Fanchon softly, lingering
an instant as William strode away; “I’m
not in it—not now! My husband doesn’t like it,
you know. <i>Adieu, monsieur, et merci!</i>”</p>

<p>She was smiling, a little flushed, altogether
charming, as she lifted her fawn-like countenance
to his red face. Mr. Bernstein relaxed and
grinned knowingly.</p>

<p>“I see! I’m sorry, madam. Put my foot in
it, eh?” He lowered his voice. “I’ll make it
eight hundred a week—see?”</p>

<p>She nodded, but William had turned a white
face toward them, and she fled lightly, following
him in his hasty stride through the now crowded
dining-room. She had caught her wraps up hastily
and thrown them about her shoulders, and
the chiffon frills framed her small, pointed chin.</p>

<p>The diners—belated motorists and traveling
salesmen—stared delightedly. The scene was as
plain as a charade, the angry young husband and
the lovely, coquettish, frivolous young wife. Fanchon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
caught whispers of admiration and glances
of sympathy. At another moment they would have
pleased her, would have appealed to every instinct
of her light, admiration-loving nature, but to-night
she saw some one ahead, some one whom
she must pass, and she was thinking, thinking
hard and fast, her heart beating pitifully under
the splendor of her dancing dress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile William stalked ahead, with his
square jaw set and his eyes stormy. He wanted
to wring Bernstein’s neck and he could not. It
made his hands clench and unclench nervously at
his sides.</p>

<p>As they neared the door, a tall man rose from
a crowded table and greeted Fanchon in French
with an effusion that made William halt. Corwin
caught his eye and bowed.</p>

<p>“Present me to your husband,” he said to Fanchon.</p>

<p>She turned with that delicate grace which made
her small figure seem so light and buoyant. She
had rallied all her forces, all her will. She smiled,
her eyes shining dangerously.</p>

<p>“William, this is my old friend, Mr. Corwin.”</p>

<p>William shook hands stiffly.</p>

<p>“We’re just going,” he said shortly. “Good
night!”</p>

<p>Fanchon laughed, half-apologetic, half-coquettish;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
but she found herself hurried out into the
hall.</p>

<p>“Who’s that fellow?” asked William sharply.
She was still laughing, half hysterical.</p>

<p>“Caraffi’s manager, Aristide Corwin—I’ve
known him for ages.”</p>

<p>William grunted.</p>

<p>“Looks like a Monte Carlo gambler,” he said,
and signaled for a taxi.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia</span> bade Lucas stop the horses. The old
wagonette was on its way out to Denbigh Crossing,
and Daniel Carter had just come in sight.
Virginia thought she had never seen him look
so pale.</p>

<p>“He looks ill, and his limp is bad, too, poor
fellow!” she breathed to herself; but she smiled,
leaning over the back of the seat to shake hands.</p>

<p>“Where have you kept yourself, Dan?” she
asked kindly, with the sweetness in her tone that
Daniel had come to recognize as pity. “Grandfather
has been asking for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he wants the book he lent me,” said
Daniel, looking up at her and aware of the softness
of her glance. She looked lovely, that same
old shade hat looped down and the knot of pink
under her chin; but the muslin dress was dotted
white Swiss this time, with a little opening at
the neck that showed a lovely throat. “I’ll bring
it back this week.”</p>

<p>“Fie! As if he wanted the old book! We’ve
missed you, Dan.”</p>

<p>He flushed boyishly and let his eyes dwell upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
her. And, for the first time in her life, Virginia
blushed consciously under Daniel’s look.</p>

<p>“Have you really?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Really and truly!” She nodded at him, smiling.
“I should have written you a note about it—invited
you to dinner, in fact, if it had not been
for our—our concert—” She blushed this time,
remembering suddenly that there must have been
an earthquake in the Carter house. “I’ve just
finished settling up the accounts with Mrs. Payson,”
she added hurriedly. “I’m glad it’s over!”</p>

<p>There was a ghost of laughter in Daniel’s eyes,
but he kept a sober face.</p>

<p>“It was a success, then, Virginia?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! We paid in our full share; no one
out of pocket except Mr. Payson. You know, he
paid Caraffi. Dan, did you hear Caraffi play?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’d rather hear you.”</p>

<p>“Mercy! Don’t say that out loud.” She
laughed, but her blush deepened. It seemed to-day
as if there was something new in Daniel,
something she did not understand. “Come and
hear me play, though, and I’ll believe you.”</p>

<p>Daniel glanced at the very conscious but decorous
back of Lucas, and smiled. No one was ever
worried about what Daniel said!</p>

<p>“I’m coming. I’ve been wanting to come all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
along,” he said gravely; “but—I’m afraid of
wearing out my welcome.”</p>

<p>She looked surprised, then, catching his eye,
realized that Daniel had been afraid that William’s
brother was unwelcome. She blushed gloriously
this time.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t—you couldn’t if you tried,” she
said softly. Then to the coachman: “Go on,
Lucas. I mustn’t keep you, Dan, but be sure you
come soon.”</p>

<p>He stood bare-headed in the sunshine, watching
the old wagonette disappear; then he put on his
hat and walked haltingly and slowly toward the
court-house. He was to address the jury in the
afternoon, and in some way the sight of Virginia
always helped him. He seemed to carry her smile,
like sunshine, into the old dim court-room. He
always spoke well afterward, so well that he was
getting the name of an orator without being aware
of it.</p>

<p>Plato had just served a light lunch for Colonel
Denbigh on the lawn. The old man, sitting under
his favorite horse-chestnut-tree, ate sparingly
and drank one iced julep, made in the old Virginia
style. He had finished, and Plato was holding
the lighter for his cigar.</p>

<p>“Go to the concert the other night, Plato?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Miss Virginia says you carried her bundles, and
she thinks you heard it all.”</p>

<p>Plato held the lighter dexterously.</p>

<p>“Yessuh, I went ’long wid Miss Jinny. Didn’t
pay no ’mission fee, jus’ walked righ’ in, same
as Miz Payson an’ de quality. Yessuh, de music
mighty fine, but I was lookin’ at young Miz Carter
when she was dancin’. Dat’s what done took dis
yere nigger!”</p>

<p>The colonel puffed at his cigar, a twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>“Like it, Plato?”</p>

<p>“Yessuh! It was de mos’ circumspecklar
dancin’ I ever see, suh, it sho was. I ain’t seen
nuffin like it since de circus. But Mirandy Parsons,
de collud girl dat works at Miz Carter’s,
she says dere was terr’ble goings-on dere ’bout dis
yere dance. She ’lowed Mist’ Carter mos’ throw
a fit.”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh took off his hat and ran his
fingers through his white hair.</p>

<p>“It was a great dance, Plato, a great dance.”
He shook with silent laughter. “Some of the
weaker brethren had to leave, though.”</p>

<p>“Dey sho did, suh! I met de Baptist minister
comin’ out, an’ de ladies was wid him. Dey was
sayin’ something ’bout dat dance in de Bible, an’
’bout John de Baptist’s head on a charger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Seems like he took it hard—I don’t mean John
de Baptist, but de minister. Done paid five dollahs
fo’ his sittin’, an’ couldn’t set out no five
dollahs’ worth. Dat’s what got him mad, suh, it
sho was.”</p>

<p>The colonel shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>“He got more than five dollars’ worth out of
that dance, Plato! There’s Miss Jinny now,” he
added, glancing down the driveway. “You go and
help her out with her packages.”</p>

<p>The old wagonette had entered the gateway,
and Plato hurried off across the lawn; but the
horses stopped short, and Virginia got out, meeting
some one who had entered from the opposite
direction. The colonel, well in the shade of his
horse-chestnut, removed his cigar from his mouth.
He was startled. The visitor was William Carter.</p>

<p>While Plato was taking a number of small packages
from the wagonette, the pair greeted each
other in the sunlit space of the old driveway.
Something in their faces made the colonel rise
silently and deftly beat a retreat. He passed behind
the old box hedge and made his way back
to the house.</p>

<p>“I reckon they’d like to have it out by themselves,”
he thought.</p>

<p>Virginia, meanwhile, came across the lawn with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
William Carter. She stopped as she came near
the horse-chestnut.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought grandfather was here!” she
exclaimed, and then to William: “Won’t you
sit down? I’ll call him.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t come to see him,” said William
quietly. “I came to see you, Virginia. I suppose
I may sit down just the same?”</p>

<p>She blushed.</p>

<p>“Of course!” She took off her hat and laid
it on the rustic table, and the sunshine seemed
to caress the strands of gold in her soft hair.
“We like to sit out here, you know, in summer.
It seems so good to be out-of-doors. Do you notice
what a view we have, since they cut that
new street through?”</p>

<p>She was talking hurriedly, a little nervously,
not looking at him. It was their first moment
alone together since his return, and Virginia was
not quite sure of herself. She pointed out the
view.</p>

<p>William turned and looked at it absently.</p>

<p>“You can see a long way, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and there’s such a glimpse now of blooming
things. The old magnolia’s full of buds.”</p>

<p>“Fanchon doesn’t like these things,” said William
moodily. “They bore her. She says she’d
rather see one of those electric signs in New York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
flashing Budweiser beer in and out, than sit here
and count lightning-bugs!”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed, blushing again.</p>

<p>“What would we do if we all liked the same
thing?” she asked lightly, and then, very sweetly:
“William, I think your wife is beautiful. At
first, one can’t decide, the face is so charming, so
piquant; but when she smiles and those dark eyes
of hers dwell on you—she’s beautiful!”</p>

<p>William said nothing for a moment. He was
sitting in the colonel’s chair, his hat on his knees,
and Virginia could see new haggard lines in his
face. He did not look at her, but away toward
a distant spire that appeared above the thick foliage,
like a finger pointing upward.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s beautiful,” he admitted at last, almost
with reluctance.</p>

<p>Virginia, aware that he was thinking of days
long ago, when he had taken her to church and
carried her books home from school, felt her
breath coming short. She was trying hard, but
if he would not meet her half-way, how could she
patch it up?</p>

<p>She averted her face, toying with her grandfather’s
empty glass. The ice still jingled in it
a little, and William started. He remembered
jingling the ice in the glasses on the inn table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and Fanchon’s eyes seemed to mock him. He drew
a long sigh.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind my sitting here, Virginia,”
he said gravely. “It’s—it’s so homelike.
I can’t bear to go. I suppose lost spirits hang
around sometimes outside the gates of paradise.”</p>

<p>Virginia caught her breath this time. She
dared not look at him. She had taken a ring
out of her pocket and held it out in the palm of
her hand; but now, looking at his set profile, she
hardly dared to speak of it. Her hand trembled;
he was unhappy, and he had come to her! Something
like fear showed in her eyes, but she forced
herself to speak.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d come in and see grandfather.
He’d be glad, I know. We meant to come to see
your wife again—some evening when you would
be at home.”</p>

<p>William lifted his head slowly and looked at
her.</p>

<p>“Virginia, I got the letters you sent me,” he
said in a low voice. “The reason I didn’t return
yours was—I burned them one night in Paris just
before—”</p>

<p>He stopped, unable to go on, red in the face;
but she was quite calm. His very embarrassment
steadied her.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” she said. “I’m glad you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
spoke, because I wanted to give you this.” She
held out her hand with the ring in her palm. “I
know it belonged to your grandmother. I was
afraid to trust it to the mails. Here it is, William.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand stiffly, without looking
at her, and Virginia had to put the ring into it.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Then he looked in a dazed way at the ring
lying in his hand. The color slowly receded from
his flushed face and left it pale. He remembered
the day he had put it on her finger!</p>

<p>So did she; but Virginia was a brave woman.
She could not help seeing his face, and, being a
woman, she knew. She could shape the whole
story easily now. She had heard rumors of Mr.
Carter’s wrath at Fanchon’s dance, and she knew
what William must have felt. The talk must
have reached him. This was the recoil. She loved
him, and she understood. It would have tempted
another woman; it frightened Virginia. She tried
to think of something to say, but she could not.</p>

<p>They sat silently, the shade of the horse-chestnut
stretching over them. Beyond them the sun
shone on the old lawns and flower-beds. They
were so motionless that a robin, searching for
worms, came almost up to their feet.</p>

<p>“Do you mind my sitting around here?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
asked again in a low voice. “It’s the most restful
place I’ve found.”</p>

<p>She steadied her voice.</p>

<p>“It is a restful place. Once we thought we’d
have to give it up, but some stocks paid in, and
we saved it. I’m so glad!”</p>

<p>William straightened himself.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>She was startled. She had not thought that
he would take it in this way. Everything led
them into the shoals, it seemed. She smiled, but
her lips shook.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any one knew it but Dan,” she
replied gently. “Dan helped us save it.”</p>

<p>“Dan?” He turned and looked at her, plainly
startled, too, by another thought. “Dan?”</p>

<p>She met his look steadily this time.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan. He’s so good to us. I think he’s
very noble.”</p>

<p>William stared at her, paling again. A kind of
fury came into his look, and she saw it. He was
jealous of Dan! She understood now. That poor
girl, his wife, had been a wild fancy, an episode,
no more, and he was waking up.</p>

<p>She rose slowly to her feet.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said. “I’m going in. Grandpa
is there, and you must come in and see him.”</p>

<p>She turned as she spoke, and William got to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
his feet, still white and haggard, his eyes following
her. But Virginia stopped abruptly. Before
them on the lawn, unheard and unseen in
her approach, stood a small, white-clad figure in
a daring scarlet hat, pale and piquant.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you heard me,” said Fanchon
softly, her dark eyes flashing from one to the
other. “You weren’t listening!” And she laughed
shrilly.</p>

<p>William crimsoned, but Virginia was calm.</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t,” she replied simply; “but I’m
glad to see you. We were just going into the
house—will you come, too?”</p>

<p>Fanchon lifted her fawn-like eyes slowly to the
other girl’s face. There was something noble in
it, too noble for the retort that was on the end
of her sharp tongue. She colored angrily.</p>

<p>“Of course! I came to call,” she said lightly.
“William got ahead of me, I see.”</p>

<p>Virginia did not reply to this. She was already
at the piazza steps.</p>

<p>“Please come this way,” she said lightly.</p>

<p>But Fanchon did not answer her. She had
approached her husband, her large eyes mocking
him, her lips parted. A strange look, half elfish,
half fond, was on her face.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be in such a hurry to hide that
ring,” she said below her breath. “I know about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
it. There was one letter you forgot to burn,
<i>mon ami</i>!”</p>

<p>He turned from red to white. His only comfort
was Virginia’s noble, unconscious look as she
led the way into the house.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Denbigh</span> accompanied his guests to the
door, and, after the farewells were sufficiently
prolonged to suit his old-fashioned ways, he stood
on the piazza and watched them to the gate.
Fanchon turned there, a small, graceful creature,
and kissed her hand to him. The colonel waved.
William raised his hat, and the two figures turned
off into the street.</p>

<p>As they grew smaller in the distance, Virginia
came out and stood beside her grandfather.</p>

<p>“A pretty creature,” said the colonel thoughtfully.
“Claws in velvet! What do you think
of her, Jinny?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Virginia replied honestly.
“She’s pretty—but there’s something I can’t describe.
She’s like a wild bird just put in a gilt
cage. It’s a terribly trite simile, but it fits her.
She’s beating her wings.”</p>

<p>“That’s poetry, Jinny,” said the colonel, chuckling.
“It’s because she’s young and pretty. If
she’d been a man, with that kind of an eye, we
would have said something about beating his hoofs—I
mean cloven ones. She sings like a bird,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
dances like a fairy, and behaves—well, I remember
that Mrs. Payson called her something in
French. What was it, eh? Maybe it takes French
to express her.”</p>

<p>Virginia flushed.</p>

<p>“She called her a little <i>étourdie</i>. Of course she
does queer things; she’s not well-bred, and she
seems like a bundle of impulsive whims, but she’s
rather captivating in all of them, and fascinating
in some.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” The colonel pulled his mustache
thoughtfully. “I see you’re determined to like
her, Jinny.”</p>

<p>“I want to—yes.”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” said the colonel gently, laying
his hand on her shoulder. “It’s a case of sugar
and salt, you can’t mix ’em. Don’t try too hard,
Jinny. Leave her alone.”</p>

<p>Something in his tone made Virginia look up
quickly.</p>

<p>“Why, sir?”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh hesitated; then he blushed like
a girl.</p>

<p>“I don’t talk scandal, Jinny, you know that,
but I hear some. Let her alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that dance—”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, not the dance. That only unloosed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
tongues. You spoke of that man, Caraffi’s manager—what
was his name?”</p>

<p>“Corwin. A horrid creature,” said Virginia,
suddenly recalling Fanchon’s face when she saw
him in the waiting-room of the hall.</p>

<p>The colonel nodded.</p>

<p>“Corwin—that’s the name. Well, William’s
wife knows him, she’s been seen walking with
him. There’s talk about it. It may be all false,
but I’d rather you kept away.”</p>

<p>Virginia had grown very thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I remember now, grandfather. She seemed
afraid of him, poor girl. He’s a terrible creature,
I’m sure—I wonder if he isn’t doing it on purpose?
Starting the talk, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said the colonel dryly; “but
he’d have to have something to start on. When
there’s so much smoke, there’s some fire. I don’t
like her, and yet”—he smiled—“what a pretty
creature!”</p>

<p>“She’s not twenty, I’m sure. I think it’s wicked
to talk so about her.” Virginia flushed generously.
“Why are people so cruel?”</p>

<p>The colonel smiled.</p>

<p>“Jinny,” he said gently, “that little woman
wouldn’t raise her finger to save you from the
gallows.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s blush deepened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“That doesn’t matter, grandfather!”</p>

<p>The old man looked at her proudly. She was
standing beside him, her tall young head nearly
level with his own, and her charming profile
toward him. She had a look that was better in
his eyes than mere beauty—a look of noble purity.
He had never known her, even in childhood, to
tell a falsehood. He patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I leave it to you, Jinny. I reckon I can trust
you. But there’s one thing I want to say.” He
hesitated, then he finished firmly: “That boy,
William, disappoints me. He’s lost his grip. He’s
been keeping gay company, I reckon, and he looks
as if he’d been drinking. If it wasn’t for his
lameness, Daniel’s twice the man!”</p>

<p>Virginia said nothing. She couldn’t; her heart
was beating in her throat. She remembered William’s
face when she returned the ring.</p>

<p>The colonel kept his hand on her shoulder, and
they stood together, looking out across the close-cut
lawn. Lucas, having put up the horses, was
running a lawn-mower near the gate. It was
that hour when the shadows begin to lengthen
and one perceives the fragrance of the honeysuckle.
It seemed to penetrate the late, warm
afternoon, and to gather bees.</p>

<p>“Jinny, who’s that man—the fat man with a
bald head?” the colonel asked presently. “He’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
either a real-estate man or a lunatic. He wants
to buy the place, I reckon. See him?”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had been in a trance, roused herself.
Her eyes fell on a stout figure advancing
toward the piazza, hat in hand.</p>

<p>“He wants to tune the piano, grandpa, or to
varnish the mahogany tables.” She laughed
softly, and fled lightly toward the door. “I’m
going. You can send him away. I refuse to be
varnished!”</p>

<p>The colonel heard her flight to the stairs; but
he stood his ground and waited, a twinkle in his
eye. The stout man approached steadily, with
an expression of genial politeness. He had an
air of feeling his own importance, but being willing
to condescend. He wore a finely-tailored suit,
a sport necktie with a diamond pin, and in the
sunshine, his bald head looked like a piece of polished
pink coral set in Florida moss.</p>

<p>“Colonel Denbigh, I believe?” he said suavely.</p>

<p>The colonel bowed politely.</p>

<p>“That’s my name, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein presented his card.</p>

<p>“I’d like a word with you, colonel. Strictly
business—important, confidential business.”</p>

<p>The colonel regarded him a moment with the
same twinkle in his eyes; then he descended the
piazza steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Come this way, Mr. Bernstein. I like to sit
out of doors. Have a cigar?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein accepted. They had reached the
back of the house now, and he stopped short.</p>

<p>“Gee, what a view! Ain’t that about three
thousand feet out there? Finest three-reel picture
I ever got in a bird’s-eye view! Only wants
a little life in it, colonel—a cow and a rough-rider,
and maybe a couple of bandits. It’s just the set—with
them mountains behind.”</p>

<p>The colonel, who had reached his favorite seat
under the horse-chestnut, looked startled.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re a movie man, aren’t you?”
he inquired mildly.</p>

<p>“Had ’em before?” Mr. Bernstein looked anxious.</p>

<p>“One or two. This place seems to appeal to
them. Sit down, Mr. Bernstein, you’ll find that
seat comfortable. I always take this one—I’m
getting old and set in my ways. I suppose it’s
the place you’re interested in?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein edged his chair closer to the
wicker table and leaned across it.</p>

<p>“Say,” he began with a glow of enthusiasm,
“this place and that servant and you! It would
be great. I says to Greenfield—he’s my best director—I
says to him before I came up here, ‘Now
what we want is one of them old-time, sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
before-the-war Southern aristocrats.’ When I saw
you, colonel, I—gee, sir, I says to myself: ‘Sammy
Bernstein, there’s your man!’ It ain’t your
clothes, colonel, it’s the way you look. Say, I’ve
got a fellow at the studio—dress him up in a
silk hat and white tie and patent-leather pumps,
and he looks like a duke. But you put that guy
into his every-days, and, bless your soul, you
wouldn’t know him from a tin-peddler! Now, it
ain’t so with you. You’d look the part in your
shirt-sleeves. When I saw you, I says to myself:
‘Sam Bernstein, there’s the real article—ain’t
any near-seal about that, either!’”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bernstein, say no more,” said the colonel.
“I’m a modest man!”</p>

<p>Bernstein expanded, smiling.</p>

<p>“Sir, I’ll make it two thousand dollars for
this place, that old negro, and you in one five-reeler.
Two thousand dollars down! Isn’t any
work in it. You just stand and look natural.”</p>

<p>This time the colonel’s eyes did more than twinkle;
he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bernstein, I never looked natural before
a camera in my life. I’m afraid we can’t come
to an agreement. I’m too old for the movies, sir.
I’ll have to decline.”</p>

<p>Bernstein’s face fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“You don’t mean it, colonel; you can’t mean
that!”</p>

<p>The colonel nodded, then he pulled a moment
at his cigar.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I do mean it. Perhaps Plato—that’s
my man—might be interested. I’ll ask
him.”</p>

<p>Bernstein held up his hands.</p>

<p>“Not without you, colonel!” He sat and stared
for a moment at the old man opposite, a look
of hopeless commiseration on his face. “Say,”
he groaned at last, “you people down here haven’t
got any enterprise! This is my second experience.
I’m surprised, colonel; I’m pained. This
town—it’s perfect, sir, for the part, it’s kind of
dead-and-alive and shady, and there’s the pickaninnies.
You could do any amount of close-ups
and cut-backs on ’em. Gee, it’s too bad!” He
shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>“I reckon you could get the pickaninnies all
right,” remarked the colonel comfortingly.
“Tried it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir! I’ve been after Mrs. William Carter.
Know her?”</p>

<p>The colonel, a little startled, took the cigar
from between his teeth.</p>

<p>“I have that honor, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>The motion-picture manager turned his head
slowly and gave him a cryptic look. Then he
knocked the ashes from his cigar, stuck it in the
other corner of his mouth, and resumed sadly:</p>

<p>“It was that dance of hers. That’s what took
me! At the church sociable, colonel. Believe me,
I was never so thrilled in my life. I was doin’
the town, looking for a place”—Mr. Bernstein
waved his hand with a melancholy air—“for this
place, sir. Well, I was goin’ down Main Street,
an’ I see them headlights. ‘Something doing
here,’ thinks I, ‘an’ I’ll have a look.’ Didn’t expect
anything; but somehow I went in, an’ the
very first thing I see is that dance. Gee whiz! I
says to myself: ‘Sammy Bernstein, this is your
lucky day; this is a find!’”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh laid down the stump of his
cigar and pulled his mustache.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve asked her?”</p>

<p>“I did. And I’ll say right now that I don’t
think—what’s his name?—Mr. William Henry
Carter’s got any horse-sense. He took on as if
I’d insulted him when I was offerin’ his wife
five hundred dollars a week. That’s what I offered,
Colonel Denbigh—five hundred dollars a
week, good money.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked reflective.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re behind the times down here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Mr. Bernstein. I reckon Mr. Carter doesn’t like
publicity. We’re quiet, backwoods people, sir,”
he added with a twinkle. “I know the lady. She’s
mighty pretty, and I agree with you she’d make
a mighty fine picture. Just the style you want,
too.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not my style. The public—well, it’s
this way. They like ’em small, an’ this lady’s
just the pattern—a cute, dark little thing. Personally”—Mr.
Bernstein sighed—“I like ’em
large. Now there’s Rosamond Silvertree—you
know her, of course, colonel?”</p>

<p>Again the colonel smoothed his mustache
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I do, sir,” he replied gently.
“Pretty name, though?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know Rosamond Silvertree?” Mr.
Bernstein struck the table with the palm of his
hand. “Sir, you’re behind your times! She’s a
motion-picture star, sir! She’s my ideal woman,
Colonel Denbigh. She’s five feet eleven inches,
and she weighs one hundred and eighty-seven
pounds. She’s a peach, sir! Got those blue eyes
that go to the heart, and her hair’s the color of
butter—makes you think of good butter in spring-time!
I have her on the screen all the time. The
poor girl’s nearly worn out. The only trouble
is you can’t always get men to play opposite to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
her. Greenfield comes up one day last month.
‘Sammy,’ says he, ‘I can’t put Rosy in “The
Dream of the Harem.”’ ‘What in thunder d’you
mean by that?’ says I. ‘Can’t do it,’ says he.
‘Jack Pickling’—that’s our leading man—‘Jack
Pickling looks like a shrimp beside of her!’ What
d’you think I did, Colonel Denbigh?”</p>

<p>The colonel shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea, sir. Put her on a diet?”</p>

<p>“Diet? Rosy? No, sir! I fired Jack Pickling!”</p>

<p>Bernstein lay back in his chair and smiled.
He felt that he had reached the climax, but the
climax was lost on Colonel Denbigh.</p>

<p>“If your leading lady is so fine, I shouldn’t
think you’d need Mrs. Carter,” he observed
mildly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein smiled with a superior air.</p>

<p>“That’s just why I do need her! You see,
Rosy won’t do for these little teeny-weeny ingénue
parts. She’s too grand! Mrs. Carter’s the
kid for those. That’s what I want her for. But
this Aristide Corwin”—Mr. Bernstein leaned over
the table and touched the colonel’s sleeve with
his fat forefinger—“Aristide ain’t behaving like
a gentleman, Colonel Denbigh. He knew the lady
in France, and he’s got some kind of a pull. I
guess he wants her in vaudeville again. She’s
been there once, I know. He’s using his methods—they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
ain’t mine, sir! He’s talkin’ bad, he—”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh rose abruptly and stood looking
down on Mr. Bernstein from his full height.</p>

<p>“I know the Carters, sir,” he said sternly.
“I’ve known Mr. Johnson Carter since I was a
young man. His boys played on this place. I
have the honor of his daughter-in-law’s acquaintance.
You will kindly drop this subject, sir!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein rose also. He was very pale, but
the small eyes in the creases of his fat face looked
honest. They even looked indignant.</p>

<p>“No offense, colonel,” he said, “no offense. If
you’re a friend of the lady, I think you ought to
know. Corwin’s been persecuting her before.
I’ve heard he drove her out of London. He’s
after her again, he means mischief. I know Aristide!
If you’re—”</p>

<p>He stopped with his mouth open. The colonel
had walked away and left him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be darned!” said Mr. Bernstein,
staring after the old man’s erect figure. “I’m
darned! Now, Sammy Bernstein, that comes of
trying to help a woman. Never again!”</p>

<p>He selected a cigar from the box that Colonel
Denbigh had unwittingly left upon the table, and,
having lit it with the colonel’s match, he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
slowly and thoughtfully away. As he went, he
sighed.</p>

<p>“Too bad, too bad!” he muttered. “Take him
all around, the lean way he stands—with striped
trousers an’ that property coat—he’d make just
an ideal close-up! I wonder”—he rubbed his
bald head thoughtfully—“I wonder if he’d have
dropped if I’d offered him three thousand dollars
to play <i>Uncle Sam</i> opposite to Rosy’s <i>Liberty</i>?”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Johnson Carter</span> sat in the old rocker in
the library, rocking nervously, her feet tapping
the floor. Her usually placid face had of late
become as troubled as an inland lake assailed by
contrary winds. It was growing full of new puckers
and furrows between the eyes.</p>

<p>She crossed and uncrossed her hands in her
lap, and glanced absently from time to time
toward the window. She happened to be alone in
the house except for Miranda. An occasional
sound from the region of the kitchen informed
her that the colored maid of all work was at the
helm; but not even the recklessness of Miranda’s
slams and thumps moved Mrs. Carter from her
chair. She was waiting for some one to come in—some
one to whom she could unbosom herself.</p>

<p>As the time passed and she heard the monotonous
ticking of the clock on the mantel, she was
seized with a kind of panic. She dreaded Mr.
Carter’s arrival. If he came first, she might
break down and tell him, and she was afraid to
tell him. She wanted Daniel. Unconsciously, in
her hour of need, she always turned to Daniel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
now. William had been her mainstay, but it was
obvious that William could not be her mainstay
any longer. The old saw about a son marrying
a wife held good in his case.</p>

<p>She waited, and the clock ticked tumultuously,
as clocks do when you wait. She began to rock
violently again, and she nearly upset herself by
a tremendous start when the door finally opened.
She thought it was Mr. Carter, but it was only
Emily with some books under her arm.</p>

<p>Emily came to the door of the library and looked
in. She had long ago obeyed her father’s order
and washed her face. It was guiltless even of
becoming makeup, but she had an unnatural look
to her mother for all that.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mama?” she asked.
“Where’s Fanchon? Has Leigh come in?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter shook her head. She had stopped
rocking and was staring at her daughter. Emily
saw it and retreated.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go up-stairs,” she said hurriedly.
“I passed the exams, mama. Mr. Brinsted says
I can go to high school in September.”</p>

<p>A gleam of momentary pleasure shot across
Mrs. Carter’s worried face, but she did not withdraw
her fixed gaze.</p>

<p>“Emmy, you come here,” she said suddenly. “I
want to look at your dress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Emily backed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to go up-stairs, mama. I’m hot
and tired. Mr. Brinsted’s so prosy. Sallie Payson
says—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rose and made a dive at the hem
of her daughter’s skirt.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” she exclaimed. “I couldn’t
think what made it hang like that! You’ve been
taking it in on every seam to make it narrower.”</p>

<p>Emily pulled away, blushing.</p>

<p>“It was just horrid—all out of style, mama!”
she cried. “I hate to—to look like a frump!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter straightened up from her consideration
of the skirt.</p>

<p>“Where did you get those striped silk stockings,
Emily Carter?”</p>

<p>Emily, backing toward the door, looked sullen.</p>

<p>“Dan gave me the money,” she answered shortly.
“I wanted something like other girls.”</p>

<p>“I never saw such awful stockings in my life!”
replied her mother. “Your legs look like barbers’
poles. You take them off, or I’ll have to tell
your father.”</p>

<p>Emily grew tearful.</p>

<p>“I—I think you’re real mean, mama. I hate
to be a frump!”</p>

<p>“Who called you a frump?” her mother asked
severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“N-no one—but Fanchon says the people here
are all provincials and frumps—all of them!”
stormed Emily. “And I think we’re awful frumps
ourselves!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter gazed at her in a dazed way;
then she retreated to her rocking-chair.</p>

<p>“Emily, you go up-stairs and rip those inside
bastes out of that skirt. It looks frightful; it
hangs all up and down in waves! And listen—”</p>

<p>Emily, still sniffing violently, was half-way to
the stairs.</p>

<p>“Listen, Emily, you take off those stockings,
too. They’re vulgar. If you don’t, I’ll have to
do it myself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I can’t wear them!” Emily
stormed. “I’m grown up, I’m sixteen, and Fanchon
has a pair like them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter flushed.</p>

<p>“You go up-stairs and take them off!” she
cried, with her first dash of anger. “I don’t
want my girl to look like Fanchon!”</p>

<p>Emily grasped the banisters and shouted.</p>

<p>“She’s lovely; she’s stylish! I think you and
papa are just awful to her. You’re setting Willie
against her, too. Leigh thinks so; he says he’d
do anything, he’d die for her!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter looked a little startled, but she
rallied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Leigh’s only eighteen,” she observed dryly.
“It’s very easy to die for people at eighteen!
You’re impertinent to your mother, Emily. Go
up-stairs and study for an hour. Mind you take
off those stockings!”</p>

<p>Emily began to cry. She cried easily, large
tears rolling out of her light-blue eyes. She went
up-stairs looking like Niobe, and she cried all
the time she was taking off her stockings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter stopped rocking and thought. She
thought deeply. Emily’s outburst and Leigh’s
devotion were such obvious things, and yet—</p>

<p>She lifted her handkerchief and pressed it
against her trembling lips. Was William really
being set against his wife? Mrs. Carter was a
good woman, and the thought distressed her.</p>

<p>She did not resume her rocking, she sat motionless,
looking straight ahead of her, her face red.
She was still sitting there when Daniel, returning
early from court, stopped at the door and
looked in.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mother?” he asked pleasantly.
“You look out of sorts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, please come in here a moment; I
want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Daniel looked a little surprised, but he came in
obediently, putting a pile of law-books and papers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
on the table as he sat down to listen. His
mother saw the papers.</p>

<p>“Did you win that case, Dan?”</p>

<p>His face lit up.</p>

<p>“Yes. Just heard the verdict. We’ve got it,
mother!”</p>

<p>She flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Dan, the judge says you’ll be a great man
some day. You’re a born orator!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Daniel, but he blushed.</p>

<p>It seemed to his mother’s anxious eyes that he
was less worn and tired than usual; but her mind
was full of other things.</p>

<p>“Dan,” she began in a low, horrified voice,
“have you seen anything? I mean—Fanchon
and that—that man?”</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m too busy, mother.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter sank back in her rocking-chair and
looked weak.</p>

<p>“I saw them this morning. I’d been to market.
Mrs. Payson came along in her new limousine,
and she stopped and picked me up. I don’t know
why it had to happen so, but the chauffeur took
the short cut for this house—you know, the little
lane behind the Methodist church.”</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and Daniel nodded. He
was very grave now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“As we turned the corner we both saw them—I
mean Mrs. Payson and I—and of course the
chauffeur did, too, come to think of it. Fanchon
was talking to that man—I think his name’s Corwin.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, if she knows him, perhaps she
had to speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Speak to him? They were walking up and
down in that out-of-the-way corner, and they were
quarreling. I’m sure they were quarreling. They
didn’t notice us.”</p>

<p>“Quarreling?” Daniel laughed. “I thought
you were going to say that he was making love
to her.”</p>

<p>“It’s just the same thing—the way they looked.
Mrs. Payson thought so, too. Daniel, there’s talk
about them; I know there is! What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’d better leave it alone,
mother?” Daniel suggested. “I’m not sure that
we’re not to blame. Fanchon seems to think we
are.”</p>

<p>“You’re not taking her part, are you, Dan?
Emily—that child’s ridiculous, she’s copying her—Emily
says we’re setting Willie against her.”</p>

<p>Daniel smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Emmy’s right,” he said quietly.
“It’s too bad, mother.”</p>

<p>“We never meant to do that—I mean your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
father and I!” cried Mrs. Carter with emotion.
“I can’t see why those two children adore her
so. Emmy says Leigh would die for her!” she
added with a tremulous laugh.</p>

<p>“She’s got Leigh twisted about her finger—that’s
true enough,” said Daniel, smiling grimly.
“I found a poem of his the other day. It was
addressed to ‘my soul-mate’! The mate was
plainly Fanchon. Poor Leigh—he’ll survive it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Willie really cares about her!
I’ve been watching and watching. He’s sickened
of it all, poor dear boy! I know he’s always
loved Virginia Denbigh,” she added with conviction.</p>

<p>Daniel was silent for a moment, and then he
spoke with determination.</p>

<p>“He has no right to care for Virginia or any
one now but this poor girl. He’s married her,
and—” He paused, and added more quietly:
“Mother, I think she needs him.”</p>

<p>“There! She’s got you on her side with those—those
fawn eyes of hers!”</p>

<p>Daniel laughed.</p>

<p>“She calls me her enemy,” he replied dryly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter looked exasperated.</p>

<p>“That’s just like her! She’s so absurd, so
stagy—in a quiet family like ours, too! She makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
me hot all over.” She shuddered. “I can’t forget
that dance and those ministers.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it rather biblical, mother?” asked
Daniel, and for the first time he laughed happily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rose from her rocking-chair and
walked absently to the window, blinking a little
as she looked out into the sunshine. She sighed.</p>

<p>“Daniel, do you think I ought to tell your
father?”</p>

<p>“Tell him what, mother?”</p>

<p>“About Fanchon and that man behind the
church.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens, no!”</p>

<p>“I’ve always told your father things that—that
concerned us all.”</p>

<p>“Mother, you know what father would do—he’d
storm at William, and William’s right on
edge now. For Heaven’s sake, let them alone—those
two, I mean!”</p>

<p>She drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not tell,” she confessed; “only I
felt—I felt as if I should.”</p>

<p>“What good would it do!” her son asked her
gravely. “It would only make matters worse.”</p>

<p>“But, Danny”—she called him Danny sometimes,
as she had when he was two years old—“she’s
Willie’s wife, and she’s being talked
about!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Hush!” said Daniel, lifting a warning hand.</p>

<p>Unheard by either of them, the front door had
opened and closed. Fanchon crossed the hall
lightly, her quick ear catching their voices. She
came to the door now and stood there with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“You were talking about me,” she said with
her amazing and terrible frankness. “I heard
you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, good gracious!” Mrs. Carter fled hastily
to the door that opened into the kitchen pantry.
“I’ve got to go and see Miranda,” she panted,
and went out and shut the door.</p>

<p>Daniel, left alone, rose from his chair. He
was flushed, but his eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“We can’t help it, Fanchon,” he said amiably.
“You’re the kind, you know. You don’t leave
any neutrals in your territory.”</p>

<p>She came in and flung her hat down on the
table, uncovering her lovely, spirited head. She
was dressed in a pale-yellow, clinging garment
that seemed to reveal every line of her small
figure, and certainly displayed her ankles, in silk
stockings as amazing as Emily’s.</p>

<p>“You’re awfully good people,” she said bitterly.
“<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I’d rather meet some bad ones—who’d
let me alone. You’re helping to make
my husband hate me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Daniel’s face sobered.</p>

<p>“You’re doing William an injustice,” he said
quietly. “I’m sure he doesn’t hate you. I’m
very sure, too, that I’m not trying to make him.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes slowly to his face and
scanned it. Then she bit her lip.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you are,” she replied with
emphasis; “but your mother does, and so does
your father. And there’s no need of it—there’s
enough without that!”</p>

<p>Daniel, who was still standing, leaned against
the mantel, supporting himself and watching her
gravely, unsmilingly.</p>

<p>“Fanchon,” he said gently, “you don’t understand.
It’s been your misfortune to come to us
without knowing us. We’re just old-fashioned,
stodgy people, and you amaze us. You’re like a
bird of paradise in a chicken-yard. Give us a
little time, Fanchon.” He paused and then
added soberly: “My brother loves you.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head, her bosom rising and falling
stormily.</p>

<p>“Leigh does!” she cried in a choked voice.
“The boy—Leigh!”</p>

<p>“I mean William,” said Daniel.</p>

<p>She stared at him, breathing hard.</p>

<p>“You think so? <i>Voilà!</i> You haven’t heard him
quarrel, you haven’t seen how he takes your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
mother’s side and your father’s side against me!
And”—she laughed wildly—“you haven’t seen
him alone—under the horse-chestnut tree—with
that paragon, Virginia Denbigh!”</p>

<p>Daniel’s arm fell from the mantel. He said
nothing. He walked slowly to the table and picked
up his books and papers. But Fanchon was
stinging with anger. She had seen Mrs. Carter’s
face, she had been treated with cold politeness
by Mr. Carter, her whole wild, stormy nature was
up in arms. Because she saw it hurt, she struck
and struck deeply.</p>

<p>“I tell you she’s stealing his heart away from
me. <i>Mais hélas</i>, it doesn’t matter, she’s a paragon
and I’m a dunce! She—”</p>

<p>Daniel walked past her out of the room without
a word. But Fanchon followed him to the
door, white with rage.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> You needn’t feel like that!” she
cried shrilly. “She says she’s sorry for you because
you’re a cripple.”</p>

<p>Daniel did not pause. He heard her, but he
went on, toiling slowly upward. He never once
looked back at the little creature in the doorway,
but went steadily on with a white face and haggard
eyes.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanchon</span> did not go up-stairs. She flung herself
face downward on the lounge in the library
and writhed there, beating the old silk cushions
with her small, furious fists. In the bitterness
of her heart she thought she hated them all, every
Carter who was ever born! Because she was so
angry, so wilfully hurt, she had wreaked her vengeance
upon Daniel. She had told him a falsehood,
and now, thinking of it, she tore at the cushions
and wept hot tears.</p>

<p>She had no idea why she had done it. She
hated Virginia Denbigh, because she knew the
Carters loved Virginia. They had wanted William
to marry her, and she believed they were making
William hate his wife. She believed it from the
bottom of her soul. But why had she struck at
Daniel?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because he was William’s
brother; perhaps it was because Fanchon had
divined that he loved Virginia.</p>

<p>Virginia, with her calm, lovely face, had become
a nightmare to Fanchon. She quarreled
with her husband, and she goaded and teased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
him, because the Carters did not like her, because
their attitude was so superior. Then she laid it
all to Virginia!</p>

<p>Fanchon had done nothing lately but quarrel
with William. He had objected to Corwin, had
forbidden her to have him at the house. Fanchon,
who feared Corwin, might have rejoiced had
she not resented her husband’s tone. He had
been set on, she thought, by Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Since that fatal dance Mr. Carter had been
coldly civil. He hadn’t considered it his duty to
scold his daughter-in-law, but he snubbed her.
Fanchon, carrying her head high, had nevertheless
been cut to the heart by it. She loved admiration,
she loved applause, she lived on excitement,
and she had none of these things, unless
she counted the admiration of Leigh and Emily—two
children, as she thought scornfully, who didn’t
know any better!</p>

<p>As she lay there on the old lounge, strange,
ancestral passions stirred in her, wild impulses
of rage and melancholy. She had had a bitter
time. The very place was intolerable; she hated
it, and she knew that the place hated her. The
stodgy, monotonous domestic life—she had to face
that, too—three meals a day with the Carters!</p>

<p>If they had liked her, if they had even made
her welcome and forgiven her unconventional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
ways, it might have been different, she thought;
but now she hated them. She knew that Mrs. Carter
had seen her in the church lane with Corwin.
Mrs. Carter had no idea of the quarrel she had
with Corwin, or her fear of him, but she must
think ill of her and run home to tattle about it!</p>

<p>Fanchon sat on the old lounge and dashed hot
tears from her eyes. She pictured herself sitting
at the luncheon-table with the family. She could
see them! Mr. Carter and William would not be
at home; but there would be Leigh, making moon
eyes, a sentimental boy, and Emily with her white
eyelashes and her honest, snub-nosed face, and
Mrs. Carter, her fair hair fading in ugly streaks,
and her absence of eyebrows. Daniel, too, his
dark, handsome head bent and his eyes indifferent—he
had never liked her! Even Miranda, moving
around cumbersomely with the dishes, would show
the whites of her eyes when she looked at her,
as if she was watching something strange and
outlandish.</p>

<p>“I might be a Fiji Islander, from the way they
look at me!” Fanchon sobbed angrily, staring
about the old room with its familiar, guttered armchairs,
its littered library-table—where Mr. Carter’s
pipe lay beside his accustomed place—and
at the dull, ancestral Carter over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>The portrait filled the latest Carter bride with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
kind of fury. She rose from the lounge and went
and stared at it.</p>

<p>“Ugly old thing!” she cried angrily. “You’d
hate me, if you could!”</p>

<p>She felt a sudden sensation of suffocation. The
place was too small for her; she couldn’t breathe
in it. She went to the window and leaned out,
staring blankly at the peaceful scene. The Carter
house was well on the outskirts of the town,
and she could glimpse a distant meadow where a
spotted cow moved placidly. A few red chickens
crossed her vision, picking in the grass. A colored
maid in the next house was pinning some
clothes on the line. Down the quiet street an ice-cart
trundled its sober, dripping way. It was
quiet again when the sound of wheels receded;
then suddenly a rooster crowed. He crowed tremendously
in a fine, deep bass.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” cried Fanchon.</p>

<p>She drew back from the intolerable prospect,
and heard Miranda setting the table for luncheon.
The faint jingle of glasses and the occasional rattle
of china warned her. The domestic meal was
approaching with its unfailing regularity. She
could not bear it. She ran out of the room, and
had one foot already on the lowest step of the
stairs, when the door opened and Leigh came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Fanchon!” he cried eagerly, his boyish face
flushing to the hair.</p>

<p>An imp of perversity stopped her. She stood
balanced, one hand on the banisters, looking back
over her shoulder. There was at least one Carter
she could manage, and she knew it. Those
fawn eyes softened and glowed.</p>

<p>“Leigh!” she responded softly. “<i>Mon brave
garçon!</i>”</p>

<p>He put his books down and came toward her
with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fanchon, what mites of feet you’ve got!”
he exclaimed, looking at the foot that she was
displaying on the step. “I never saw a foot as
small as that.”</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>“You think so, <i>chéri</i>?”</p>

<p>She moved the small foot a bit, looking down
at it, pensive, aware that he could see also the
charming sweep of those dark lashes. Leigh, long
since subjugated, dropped on one knee beside the
lowest step.</p>

<p>“If I were a prince, I’d follow that shoe,” he
laughed up at her, his boyish eyes adoring. “I’ve
read some French about a lady’s feet—in a novel.
It fits your feet, Fanchon.” He blushed. “I’m
not sure I pronounce very well, but it was this:
‘<i>Petits pieds si adorés!</i>’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>For a moment her lips trembled, half mirthful,
half tearful. She leaned toward him and stroked
his hair caressingly, her light, soft fingers thrilling
him.</p>

<p>“<i>Je t’adore, mon Leigh!</i>” she whispered.</p>

<p>Then she laughed elfishly, put one of her slender
fingers on her lip and ran up-stairs like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>Leigh slipped out of her mind in an instant.
She did not even see the adoring look that followed
her. She was bent on escaping that stodgy
family meal, and she was in hot haste. She had
thought of a way to evade it—to evade them all
for a while.</p>

<p>She was fond of riding on horseback, and William
had taken her out on several occasions. He
would have taken her more frequently if her modish
habit had not shocked the sobriety of the old-fashioned
town. It had been made in Paris, and
it had startled the streets through which they
rode. After one or two experiences William had
quietly let the rides drop. Fanchon knew why he
had done so, and it made her angry. To-day she
thought of it again, and she longed for the fresh
air in her face and the swift gallop. Even the
stupid country roads were tolerable for the sake
of that.</p>

<p>She went to her closet and dragged out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
famous breeches and riding-coat. She was putting
on the stylish leggings when Miranda
knocked.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am, Miz Carter, she say ain’t you-all
comin’ down t’ luncheon? De chops is gettin’
cold.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any luncheon,” Fanchon called
to her without opening the door. “Say that I’ve
got a headache.”</p>

<p>She heard Miranda retreating heavily; then
she slipped on her riding-habit, found her hat,
and, opening the door softly, stole down-stairs.
She could hear Mrs. Carter talking to Daniel in
a hesitating voice, and she heard Leigh answer
something. She did not want them to talk to her.
She could not bear it. She opened the door gently,
slipped out, and started almost at a run for the
livery-stable where she knew William had hired
the horses.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter had lunched down-town. He did so
when he was very busy, and he was on his way
back to his office when he encountered Judge Jessup.
The judge halted him and shook hands.</p>

<p>“Dan’s won the case!” he said with elation.
“Why weren’t you in court to hear your son plead,
Carter?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter reddened a little. He had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
thinking of William and William’s wife, and this
was a keen relief. He relaxed.</p>

<p>“I was busy. How did the boy get on, judge?”</p>

<p>The judge clapped his big hand on his old
friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Carter, he’s going to be a great lawyer! I’m
as proud of him as if I’d hatched him myself.”</p>

<p>“Poor Dan!” Mr. Carter’s face softened while
his eyes smiled. “He ought to have something
to make up—I hate to see him so lame!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! It doesn’t hurt his brains, man!”
Jessup exclaimed hotly. “He only limps a little.
He’s the smartest boy you have, Carter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“Think so? I wouldn’t like to say that. William’s
done well, Payson tells me; he said so a
month or two ago. They’re all pleased with the
way he handled things abroad.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” the judge cocked a humorous eyebrow.
“I thought the most William did over there was—to
get married!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter met his eye, faltered, and groaned.
The judge laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t appreciate Dan. Now, as I was
saying—”</p>

<p>He stopped with his mouth open. A horse came
down the main street at a hard gallop. There
was a distinct sensation. The drivers of passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
vehicles sat sidewise; a string of little half-dressed
pickaninnies streamed along the edge of
the sidewalk in eager but hopeless pursuit. A
street-car that had stopped at the crossing failed
to go on because conductor and motorman were
gaping after the vision.</p>

<p>Riding cross-saddle, in the latest extreme of
fashion, was young Mrs. William Carter. The apparition
would have startled them at any time,
but the lady was already famous, and her progress
might be viewed somewhat in the light of a Roman
triumph.</p>

<p>Very pale, her dark eyes shining and her lips
compressed, Fanchon struck her steed sharply
with her riding-crop. The horse, a spirited young
bay, came on at a gallop, with the clatter of maddened
hoofs, followed by the stream of pursuing
children and their wild shouts of applause. In
this fashion Fanchon dashed past Judge Jessup
and Mr. Carter and disappeared in a cloud of dust
on the highroad.</p>

<p>A comet could scarcely have had a more startling
effect. Mr. Carter said nothing, but his color
became apoplectic. He stared after her for a minute,
and then, with a set face, he turned to the
judge.</p>

<p>“What were you saying? Oh, I remember—yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> 
yes, I’ll come in to-morrow and hear Dan
address the jury,” he said hastily.</p>

<p>The judge smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“The verdict was reached to-day, Johnson.
You’re a bit behindhand.” As he spoke he held
out his hand. “Congratulations on Dan,” he said
heartily. “I’m in a hurry. Want to walk back
to my office with me?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>He knew what Jessup thought, he suspected him
of shaking with suppressed laughter, but the
judge looked innocent enough. They shook hands
again absently, having forgotten that they had
done so twice already, and Mr. Carter strode
away. He knew that he was stared at, and he
walked fast, his face still deeply red. At the
door of his office—he was in the insurance business—he
found his office-boy gaping down the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter stopped short.</p>

<p>“Here, you! Go into that office!” he said sharply.
“What are you doing out there, you young
ninny? You’ll be picked up for a street-corner
loafer if you don’t mind your own business better!”</p>

<p>The alarmed youth retreated before him, apologizing.
Mr. Carter, with his hat still on, strode
past the clerks in the outer office, went into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
own room, and slammed the door with such force
that the glass rattled.</p>

<p>One of the young stenographers looked up from
her work and laughed silently at the other.</p>

<p>“Seen his daughter-in-law?” she inquired in a
whisper.</p>

<p>The other girl nodded.</p>

<p>“She’s awfully pretty and swell, anyway,” she
murmured. “Oh, my—Minnie, look!”</p>

<p>Across the street was the old road-house where
William and his wife had supped after the dance.
As Mr. Carter’s stenographer looked out now
she saw a hastily saddled horse led to the door.
A tall man came out and swung himself into the
saddle. It was Corwin.</p>

<p>The two girls across the street rose silently and
leaned over their machines to watch him. He
rode well, turning his horse around, starting at a
quick trot, and breaking almost at once into a
gallop.</p>

<p>“He’s gone after her, Minnie!”</p>

<p>Minnie nodded; then, hearing a noise in the
inner room, they dropped into their places and
worked furiously. Mr. Carter opened the door,
looked in, and closed it sharply again. They heard
him return to his desk.</p>

<p>Minnie pulled her companion’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“He saw him!” she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>The other girl assented, touching her lips with
her finger. They could hear earthquakelike
sounds within, and they rattled away at their typewriters,
demurely silent; but through the open
window they could see, far in the distance, the
furious horseman disappearing down the turnpike.</p>

<p>His horse was a powerful animal, a far better
traveler than the young bay that had carried
Fanchon. The two girls in the office speculated
in silence, and worked rapturously. Young Mrs.
Carter was the most exciting thing in a dull town
at a dull time of the year, and they were grateful
to her.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter kept them late that day and worked
them hard. Usually an easy taskmaster, he called
them in during the afternoon and gave them page
after page of dictation. It was half past six when
he slammed down the top of his desk, locked it,
and went home.</p>

<p>He walked, and it was a long way. It was seven
o’clock when he opened the front door with his
latch-key.</p>

<p>The family were already at dinner—all but
William, who was walking up and down the hall,
looking haggard. Mr. Carter came in and hung
his hat upon the rack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Waiting for any one?” he asked his son dryly.</p>

<p>William raised his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, Fanchon. She hasn’t come in yet. I’m
expecting her any moment.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t,” his father retorted grimly.
“She’s out riding with that fellow—Caraffi’s manager.”</p>

<p>William said nothing, but he stopped short. Mr.
Carter, after eying him for an instant, went on
into the dining-room. His wife, Daniel, Emily,
and Leigh were sitting around the table, eating
the second course disconsolately.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d never come—and we were
hungry,” Mrs. Carter said apologetically. “Miranda,
go and get the soup for Mr. Carter. I had
it kept hot,” she added, glancing anxiously toward
the hall door.</p>

<p>They could hear William walking to and fro
again. As Miranda disappeared for the soup, Mr.
Carter looked up. He glanced at his wife meaningly.</p>

<p>“She’s out riding with that man,” he said in
an undertone.</p>

<p>“Johnson!”</p>

<p>His wife’s dismay only brought a grim smile to
Carter’s face. He unfolded his napkin without
further comment. Before Miranda returned with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the soup-tureen, Mrs. Carter rallied sufficiently to
lean over and murmur across the table:</p>

<p>“I’ve got a lot to tell you—that dreadful girl
was with that man this morning—behind the
Methodist Church! I saw—”</p>

<p>She stopped, for Leigh had risen suddenly. He
flung his napkin on the table and stalked out of
the room with a white face. Mr. Carter stared
after him.</p>

<p>“What the—” he began.</p>

<p>Emily touched his hand warningly. Miranda
was returning.</p>

<p>“Leigh’s awfully mashed on Fanchon,” Emily
whispered irrelevantly, returning to her dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter shut his mouth hard, and the conversation
languished. Daniel spoke once about
the weather, and his father nodded.</p>

<p>“Judge Jessup handed out a lot of compliments
for you to-day, Dan,” he remembered suddenly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter looked pleased, but even this fell
flat. They could hear William’s tramp continuing
after Leigh went up-stairs. Mr. Carter rose
once and went to the door.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming in to eat your dinner,
William?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’ve dined,” William replied shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Then I think you’d better go into the library
and sit down,” said his father meaningly.</p>

<p>William, halting in his walk, stared for a moment,
puzzled. Then he understood, and a deep
red went up to his forehead. Without a word,
he turned, went into the library, and shut the door.</p>

<p>Miranda had brought on the dessert, but only
Emily and Daniel ate it. There was a heavy
silence. Mr. Carter sat moodily, apparently listening,
and Mrs. Carter could think of nothing to
say. She tried two or three times and stopped,
aghast at her own temerity. The three vacant
chairs—William’s, Fanchon’s, and Leigh’s—seemed
to gape at them. Daniel finally rose.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to prepare a paper for Judge Jessup,”
he remarked quietly, and left the room.</p>

<p>They heard him light his cigar and go up-stairs.
It was then that Mr. Carter rose also and went
as usual into the library. Emily and her mother,
left alone, gaped at each other in a startled way.
They heard voices in the library, and then a heavy
silence, filled with the odor of tobacco. Emily began
to be a little frightened.</p>

<p>“Mama, do you suppose she’s run away?” she
whispered in an awed tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter cast a frightened look toward Miranda’s
retreating figure, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Emily. Suppose we go and sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
in the parlor? I don’t think papa wants us in the
library.”</p>

<p>They spent the evening sitting in the little unused
parlor that Fanchon hated. It was full of
heavy stuffed furniture and old-fashioned cabinets.
Accustomed to a family gathering in the
library, they languished there, watching the clock.</p>

<p>“It’s getting awfully late,” said Emily finally,
after an interminable hour. “Where can she be?”</p>

<p>“Emily,” said Mrs. Carter irrelevantly, “I
wish you wouldn’t say that Leigh is ‘mashed’ on
her. In the first place it’s absurd, and in the second
it’s vulgar.”</p>

<p>“But he is,” insisted Emily. “He’d get down
in the mud and let her walk on him—like Sir
Walter Raleigh’s cloak. He says so.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Mrs. Carter, trembling with
nervousness, discovered that it was half past ten.
“You go to bed,” she ordered shortly.</p>

<p>After her daughter went up-stairs, she sat for
a long time, waiting. She was puzzled by the
silence in the library. From time to time she went
to the window and looked out anxiously; yet she
had no real hope that her daughter-in-law would
appear. She felt sure that Fanchon had run away,
and the disgrace of it made her face burn. She
turned the gas down and sat in semi-darkness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
ashamed to look at her own image in the long
mirror between the windows.</p>

<p>The Carters had always had such good wives,
such loyal, faithful women. She had not failed
herself, she had done her best, and William, her
first-born, the pride of her heart—must he be disgraced?</p>

<p>She sat there watching and listening until nearly
twelve o’clock. Still she heard occasional
sounds from the library. Finally, worn out, she
crept up-stairs to her room; but even there she
continued to listen and tremble at intervals.</p>

<p>At last she heard the sounds of locking up the
house and her husband’s heavy step on the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter came into the room and slammed
the door. His wife had crept hastily into bed,
and she lay there, shivering a little with dread.</p>

<p>“What did you say to him, papa?”</p>

<p>“Say? Not a blamed word!” Mr. Carter sat
down and pulled off his boots, flinging one down
with violence. “I guess I don’t have to say anything,”
he remarked grimly. “I reckon the fool’s
got about enough. Marrying a French ballet-dancer!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose she is, Johnson?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? He’ll have to get a divorce—that’s
as plain as the nose on your face. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
I suppose the donkey’ll want to marry Rosamond
Silvertree, or Bloomie Bloomingkitten, or some
other actress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” groaned Mrs. Carter, burying her
head in her pillow with a sob. “I can’t bear it!
Poor Willie!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter restrained his tongue, but he flung
the other boot into the corner with a bang more
eloquent than words.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> in the library William Carter waited
alone. He was glad to be alone. Aware of his
father’s attitude, he had dragged through a fearful
evening. Mr. Carter had sat at the table,
smoking and reading his newspaper. He had said
nothing about the one subject that was uppermost
in both minds; but at intervals he had lowered his
paper sufficiently to fix a fierce eye on the clock
and then to turn it significantly upon his son.
Without meeting his glance, William felt it. With
the tide of rage and grief rising in his own heart,
that hostile eye—which seemed to say, “I told you
so!” was intolerable.</p>

<p>He was thankful when his father’s stout figure
disappeared into the front part of the house. He
heard the vigorous locking-up without protest. It
was evident that Mr. Carter had decided that Fanchon
wouldn’t return that night, and he was bound
to lock up as usual. In fact, he did it a little
more violently than usual. It was an overt act
which relieved his feelings. Then, carrying a
pitcher of iced water, he went heavily up-stairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and his son heard the sharp closing of his bedroom
door.</p>

<p>It took no very vigorous imagination, either, to
fancy his mother’s anxious inquiry for the truant,
and the subsequent comment on the situation.
Even in the solitude of the library William’s face
burned. He was bewildered, too. He knew that
he had reached a crisis, and he did not know how
to deal with it. To do anything seemed only to
publish his own misery. He had telephoned twice
to the livery-stable already, and been assured that
Mrs. Carter’s horse was still out.</p>

<p>He had no idea where she had gone, and to follow,
even in a motor, would be senseless enough.
It was a fine night; a full moon lighted the roads.
If she meant to return, she could get home so
easily that he could not believe she intended to
do so.</p>

<p>As for Corwin, William had only seen the man
two or three times, and was cognizant of the gossip
only through his father. People didn’t talk to
him.</p>

<p>His father had seen Corwin follow Fanchon, but
had Fanchon planned it all? Or had the man—a
hard, coarse-looking brute—pursued her without
any invitation, without her consent? William
Carter did not know; he only felt a blind rage that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
he had suddenly been forced to doubt his wife.
It was hideous—simply hideous!</p>

<p>They had been quarreling lately nearly all the
time—petty quarrels. Fanchon evidently hated
the place, she seemed to hate even her husband’s
people, and he had found her becoming wilder
and stranger every day. He knew she longed to
go back to Paris, or at least to New York; but
William had never brought his mind to consider
even the possibility that she was disloyal, or could
be. He could not believe it now, but he found
that the conviction was deep-rooted in his father’s
mind, and he saw it in his mother’s kind, worried
eyes.</p>

<p>What had they heard? He did not know—at
least he was sure he did not know it all. He saw
something of it in Leigh’s white face to-night.
The boy was fond of Fanchon. William felt relief
to think that at least one member of his family
liked her.</p>

<p>He watched the clock until the hands indicated
midnight. Where could she be? He walked the
floor again.</p>

<p>Unobserved, he could give way to his agony of
mind. Had there been an accident? Had Fanchon
been hurt?</p>

<p>The suspense was fast becoming a deep and
keen agony. He was shaken. He knew that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
thoughts had wandered to Virginia, to the peace
he might have had. Had Fanchon seen it? Was
she tormenting him in a wild fit of jealousy, or—intolerable
and monstrous thought!—his wife in
flight with a man who looked to him to be no
more than a common gamester?</p>

<p>How still it was! Through the open window
the soft night air poured in; and now it had a
difference, a perceptible quickening, the keenness
of the morning. It was nearly one o’clock.</p>

<p>He flung himself into a chair and waited, burying
his head in his hands. He tried to think coherently,
but he could not. Then a thrill ran
through him as the telephone-bell rang at his elbow.
He snatched up the receiver. A man’s voice
called for Mr. William Carter—a gruff, half-drowsy
negro voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! What is it?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“De boss tol’ me to watch out fo’ dat horse Miz
Carter hired, suh. I’s been up all night—dat
horse jes’ come in dis minute. He’s drippin’, an’
he ain’t got no rider, suh.”</p>

<p>William dropped the receiver and stood motionless,
as if turned to stone. Good God, how he
had wronged her! There had been an accident!</p>

<p>A vision of Fanchon lying by the wayside, her
lovely face cold in the moonlight, her helpless,
pretty, idle hands flung out, pierced his heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
He groaned aloud. Then his sickened brain
cleared and he roused himself. He must get help,
hire a motor, and go out to search.</p>

<p>He raised his head sharply. His strained ear
caught a sound at the front door. He crossed the
room almost at a stride, switched on the light in
the hall, threw back his father’s elaborate chains
and bolts with a shaking hand, and flung the door
open. On the threshold, deadly pale and dripping
wet, stood his wife.</p>

<p>“Fanchon!”</p>

<p>His first impulse of wild relief was lost in another
and a stronger feeling. The look on her
face checked the words on his lips.</p>

<p>She came in slowly, reluctantly, putting out a
small, groping hand. As the light from the hall
lamp fell full upon her, he saw that she had lost
her hat, and that her pretty hair clung in wet
curls to her forehead. All the gaiety and frivolity
of that Parisian habit was gone. It was torn
and muddy and wet. But she did not go to him,
she did not exclaim that she had been hurt and
half drowned. She walked past him, a little unsteadily,
and went into the library.</p>

<p>William shut the door and followed her. She
had dropped into a chair and lay there, half reclining,
her arm across the back and her face hidden
on it. Her husband stood looking down at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
her in silence for a moment; then he turned without
a word and went into the dining-room, poured
some brandy into a glass, and brought it.</p>

<p>“Drink this!” he said peremptorily.</p>

<p>She lifted the glass slowly, and, without raising
her eyes, tasted the liquor and then thrust it aside.</p>

<p>“I know what you think!” she said in a low
voice. “It isn’t true—I’ve done nothing—nothing
at all!”</p>

<p>His face hardened.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that, Fanchon? I haven’t
accused you.”</p>

<p>She turned with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“I know they have—your father and your
mother!”</p>

<p>William, who had taken the glass from her, set
it down on the table.</p>

<p>“You’re wet through,” he said coldly. “Go
up-stairs and change. You can talk afterward—if
you want to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I’m wet!” she answered a little
wildly. “I’d rather bear wet than your face!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry my face is so unbearable. I had
no thought when I saw you but anxiety. There’s
been an accident. You haven’t even told me
whether you’re hurt!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t an accident,” said Fanchon. “The
horse got down in the stream and wallowed. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to get off to save myself, and when he came out
he ran off.”</p>

<p>William lifted his eyes reluctantly to hers.</p>

<p>“That horse has just come in, Fanchon. I got
a telephone as you came up the porch steps.”</p>

<p>She did not seem to grasp the significance of
this. She put up a wandering hand and pushed
back her damp hair.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it!” she said sharply. “It’s so—I
never would have got here but for a motor.
Some people—perfect strangers, too—were coming
this way, and they brought me. We came
faster than any horse could go.”</p>

<p>“Where were you? Where did the horse roll?”</p>

<p>“At Fanshawe’s Creek—you know, half-way to
the Mountain Inn.”</p>

<p>William turned abruptly and walked across the
room and back again.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t take an hour and a half for a
horse,” he remarked dryly. “It’s one o’clock,
Fanchon.”</p>

<p>A flame of red shot up in her white cheeks.</p>

<p>“I think he got into the water at about eleven
o’clock. I tried to make him ford the stream, and
he—he just got down and wallowed in the water.
I had to get off.”</p>

<p>“You went out just after luncheon—while
mother was at lunch, in fact—and you were coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
home on those lonely roads at eleven o’clock
at night, alone?”</p>

<p>She sat up in her chair at that, her flushed
face turned fully toward him, and something like
a flame kindling in her fawn-like eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course your mother told you!”</p>

<p>“Told me what?”</p>

<p>“About my talk with Corwin in the lane.”</p>

<p>William stared at her.</p>

<p>“My mother told me nothing. I didn’t mean to
tell you, I didn’t mean to say anything,” he added
grimly; “but since you’ve said so much, I will. I
heard from father that Corwin followed you out
on the turnpike to-day—to the edification of the
town! Was he with you at the creek?”</p>

<p>Fanchon sat quite still, looking at him, her large
eyes seeming to grow larger and darker in her
white face. He returned the look as steadily,
not in anger, but with a kind of grimness new in
her experience with him. Neither of them moved,
and the stillness in the room was so deep that they
both heard the familiar sounds outside. The
church clock struck in the distance, and some
cocks crowed. The fresh breeze stirred the curtains
in the window while the shaded lamp on the
table flared up with the little gust. In the flare
William saw the misery on his wife’s face.</p>

<p>“Fanchon, that man’s pursuing you—he’s a villain!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
What has happened? Tell me—I have a
right to know!”</p>

<p>Something in his changed tone touched her.
She sank back in her chair, covering her face with
her hands.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she murmured brokenly, and
then, as her emotions swept her away, she burst
into wild and uncontrollable weeping, her sobs
shaking her from head to foot.</p>

<p>Something in the passion of her tears, and in
the crumpled helplessness of the small figure in
the chair, touched William in his turn. He stood
looking at her without moving, thinking unhappily.
He had made a mess of it; but after all it
wasn’t all her fault. It was his, and he still loved
her. From what he had suffered to-night he knew
that he loved her. Suddenly he bent over the
small, writhing figure and spoke.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Fanchon,” he said hoarsely. “Must
I thrash that villain?”</p>

<p>Very slowly she raised her head, very slowly
and reluctantly she raised her tear-drenched eyes
to his.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t go with him, I didn’t want to see
him—he followed me.” She hesitated, trembling.
“I don’t know how to tell you. He overtook me
and he made me come back. I’d lost my way. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
made me go back to the inn—we ate dinner together.”</p>

<p>“You dined at a public road-house with that
man—a man I wouldn’t ask to my father’s
house?”</p>

<p>She nodded, biting her lips.</p>

<p>For a moment he was hot with rage; but he
curbed it. He wanted to be just, and he was
deeply moved. As she sat there she looked as she
had looked once in Paris, when he had first seen
her—a butterfly of a creature fighting to live,
fighting hopelessly in the midst of glittering, sordid
surroundings. He hadn’t been blinded, his
eyes had been wide open, but he had fallen in love
with her; and he had been moved, too, by compassion.
He had snatched her out of that gay,
hollow sham of a life, and he had meant to save
her, to keep her safe. Yet, as she sat there now,
she looked forlorn and helpless and beset.</p>

<p>“Fanchon,” he said gravely and gently, “tell
me why you did this. You didn’t mean to do it,
you didn’t set out to do it—why did you? See, I
trust you—I’m asking you to tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>“I lost my way.” She repeated it as if she had
a lesson by rote. “Corwin overtook me and made
me turn back. I was hungry, and we ate dinner
at the same table—in the public dining-room.
Then—then I didn’t want him to ride back with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
me—and I went out of the side door and started
alone. When I came to the crossing above Fanshawe’s
Creek, I didn’t know which way to go, and
I chose the wrong road. I rode so far that I got
frightened. I asked at a house out there—a
woman with a queer name—Quantah, I think. I
had to come back to the crossing. Then, when I
did get to the creek, the horse lay down in the
water. I sat and waited, dripping, until a motor
picked me up. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“No,” said William, “that’s not all. You’re
afraid of that man, Fanchon!”</p>

<p>“I!” she laughed tremulously. “Why do you
think that?”</p>

<p>He was watching her, and he saw her eyes
change. He was right. She was afraid of Corwin.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it,” he said gravely. “I know
it. Go on, Fanchon; tell me the rest.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to tell,” she replied slowly,
deliberately, but with shaking lips. “You—you
don’t believe me, <i>n’est-ce-pas</i>?”</p>

<p>William, looking steadily into her face, made
no reply. His changed, white face frightened her.
She rose unsteadily to her feet, a forlorn little
figure.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of Corwin,” she said angrily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
“not a bit! <i>Ciel</i>, why should I be afraid of any
one? I ask you that, <i>mon ami</i>!”</p>

<p>He still said nothing, his grave eyes on hers.
Fanchon returned his look—tried to return it
steadily. She had told him a falsehood. She had
never been afraid of falsehood; it was an easy way
of escape. But now, under his eyes, she flinched.
She blushed scarlet, put out a wavering little hand,
and tried to catch at his, but he moved away.</p>

<p>“Go up-stairs,” he said gravely, without anger,
in the remote tone of a man who no longer
cared. “You’re worn out; you’ll take cold. I
told you so before. Go up-stairs to bed. Shall I
rouse Miranda? Do you need help?”</p>

<p>“Help?” she shivered, but not with cold. “<i>Non,
non!</i> No help for me—here!”</p>

<p>As she spoke she turned, lifted the discarded
glass of brandy to her lips, and drained it. Then,
without looking at him again, she left the room.</p>

<p>The light was still on in the hall, but she felt
her way to the stairs blindly. She was crying.
She had not intended to lie to him, but it was
so much easier than to tell the truth. She clung
to the banisters for a moment, sobbing bitterly;
then, dashing the tears from her eyes, she went
on, aware that he was still standing motionless
where she had left him.</p>

<p>As she dragged herself to the head of the stairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
she was suddenly aware of a figure in the upper
hall. She stopped and looked around in a panic.
She expected her father-in-law, but it was only
Leigh.</p>

<p>“Are you safe?” he asked eagerly. “There’s
been an accident—I knew it! You’ve been hurt,
Fanchon?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“Where were you, Leigh?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been up all night. I knew William was,
too, and I’ve waited.”</p>

<p>He was eighteen, but he looked younger, and
his boyish face was white with anxiety. With a
sudden impulse, Fanchon laid her hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’m safe—quite safe, dear boy!” she whispered,
and, lifting her pale, beautiful face to his,
she kissed him lightly on both cheeks. “Dear
Leigh—dear brother!” she murmured. “I shall
love you—<i>toujours</i>!”</p>

<p>Leigh, unused to being kissed, turned from
white to red, but he felt as if he had received an
accolade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> only member of the Carter family who left
the house with a cheerful face on the following
morning was Daniel. There had been practically
nothing said at breakfast. Fanchon kept to her
room, William briefly explaining the accident at
the creek and adding that his wife had a chill.
Mrs. Carter went up to see her, but was refused
admittance. So was Emily. Mr. Carter read the
newspaper more thoroughly than usual, and Leigh
ate in a dream.</p>

<p>Daniel, aware of the strained atmosphere, found
difficulty in suppressing a smile. He had encountered,
at intervals, the expressive whites of Miranda’s
eyes. She had carried up Fanchon’s
breakfast, and she knew Job Wills, the hostler at
the livery-stable, who had come by in the morning,
on his way home after an all-night shift.
What Miranda did not know about Mrs. William
Carter’s ride wasn’t worth knowing. Her eyes
nearly upset Daniel’s gravity; but he finally left
the house, feeling a little guilty. It was wrong to
find amusement in an incident that seemed so
tragic to the others. Daniel therefore suppressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the twinkle in his eyes and set out for Judge Jessup’s
office.</p>

<p>His way lay through the church lane and down
to the lower corner of the main street. It was a
way that, at this season of the year, was full of
blossoming. It was past time now for the early
flowers, but an old-fashioned clustering yellow
rose climbed over the Paysons’ fence and tossed
its fragrance and its falling petals to the passers-by
like the confetti at a carnival. A scarlet-hooded
woodpecker was climbing the tall trunk of the
old oak by the churchyard gate.</p>

<p>Daniel walked slowly. Rapid motion increased
his limp, but when he moved in his usual leisurely
way his step only halted a little. He was no longer
thinking of his own family, nor of the whites of
Miranda’s eyes. His mind had reverted, as it
usually did, to Virginia Denbigh.</p>

<p>He was not startled, therefore, when he saw
her standing at the corner of the church. She
was not wearing her big hat to-day, but an odd
little bonnet-shaped affair that showed her pretty
hair and her white forehead, and she was dressed
in pink. He thought it was the most lovely shade
of pink he had ever seen.</p>

<p>She smiled as she saw him coming.</p>

<p>“I was waiting for you, Dan.”</p>

<p>He flushed, and his eyes shone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“I like that bonnet, Virginia. At first I thought
I couldn’t like anything but the big hat, but this
shows your hair. It’s like sunshine to-day.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“My hat was a thousand years old! This is
brand-new—I trimmed it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could do anything so well,” he said in
a tone of real regret. “I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Not even a speech to the jury?”</p>

<p>She laughed a little tremulously. Something
in Daniel always touched her. She supposed it
was his accident.</p>

<p>“Any one can address a jury,” he replied, “but
no one but you could trim that bonnet, Virginia.”</p>

<p>“If you praise it so much, I shall never take
it off.” She laughed again, but her eyes grew
very grave and kind. “Dan, I heard you speak in
court yesterday.”</p>

<p>He was startled.</p>

<p>“Really? Where were you, Virginia?”</p>

<p>“Oh, way back! I was passing the court-house,
and I heard two colored men speak about it. One
said: ‘Dan Carter, he’s makin’ a great speech,
yessuh, he sho’ is. ’Pears like he’s got dat jury
all bemuzzled!’” Virginia laughed delightedly.
“I went in after that. It was so crowded I
thought I’d have to stand, but Mr. Payson was
there near the door, and he made some one bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
a chair. I could just see the back of your head,
Dan, but I heard.”</p>

<p>His face glowed now.</p>

<p>“How strange!” he exclaimed in a low voice.
“I knew you were there. No, I didn’t see you,
Virginia. I was speaking, and suddenly—well, I
felt that you were there. I remember I half looked
around. I thought you’d smile at me.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, startled look—a look that
seemed to express some new perception of him;
but his eyes were averted. He was smiling absently,
as if talking to himself.</p>

<p>“I didn’t smile, Dan,” she said softly. “I was
too deeply touched. I don’t know why we all felt
that way, but we did. Yet when I took your speech
to pieces in my mind I found how simple it was.
You just told us that man’s story, but you told it
so simply it went straight to our hearts.”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s all I can do, Virginia. I’m a simple
fellow—I can only tell the simple truth. There’s
no cause for all this—this fanfare of trumpets
in the newspapers, I mean—about my speech.
Anybody could do it.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Nobody else could do it. That’s just it.
You’re like Lincoln, Dan. They say he thought
nothing of the Gettysburg address. I believe he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
wrote it on his way there. I wish you’d tell me
when you’re going to speak again. I want to be
there; I want to hear you ‘bemuzzle’ the jury
again.”</p>

<p>His eyes lit up.</p>

<p>“Will you come? Really?”</p>

<p>“Every time—if you’ll tell me. You can phone
me, Dan.”</p>

<p>He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“I shall make great speeches, sure enough, if
you’re there! I couldn’t help it. Only I wish
you’d sit where I can see you—will you, Virginia?”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“In which hat, Dan?”</p>

<p>He considered a moment.</p>

<p>“The old one, please! When I have dreams
about you I see you in that hat.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s given you nightmare! I didn’t
know it was as bad as that!”</p>

<p>She laughed again, a little tremulously. Suddenly
she began to see what she had never quite
seen before. Poor Daniel cared for her! She was
afraid that he cared more than she had dreamed.
It touched her so much that her eyes misted.</p>

<p>“Nightmare? Not a bit of it. I tell you what
to do, Virginia—when you’re through with it let
me have it. I’ll hang it up over my desk when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
want an inspiration. A poor lawyer needs an inspiration.
The law’s as dry as dust.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes reluctantly but smilingly to
him. She had almost been afraid to meet them,
but she was not now. Dan’s look was just the
same look he had always given her—and she had
never understood!</p>

<p>“I’ll give it to you for a waste-paper basket,”
she said gaily.</p>

<p>Then she stopped, her hand on the stone gate-post
of the old church. They had been walking
slowly through the lane, and Daniel halted, surprised.</p>

<p>“Going in here, Virginia?”</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s to be a Sunday-school festival.
Besides, they’ve just cleaned up the church. I took
all our prayer-books away for the refurbishing;
now I’m going to put them back in the pew.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, he glanced down at the armful of
books she held. He had been to church with the
Denbighs more than once, and he remembered the
colonel’s big prayer-book and hymnal and the
books for their guests. He had used that old red
one himself. Then his eye fell upon two smaller
ones of brown morocco with Virginia’s monogram
on the clasp of the case.</p>

<p>“You’re still carrying your old set, Virginia,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
he remarked thoughtfully. Here was a chance
for a gift, perhaps. “They’re worn at the edges.”</p>

<p>She looked down, blushing suddenly.</p>

<p>“Are they? I hadn’t noticed.”</p>

<p>Something in her tone had made Daniel take
the books from the pile on her arm. It was a set,
prayer-book and hymnal bound in one and prettily
mounted. He slipped the clasp and opened them.
A faded pansy slipped between the pages. He
clasped it hastily and handed it back.</p>

<p>“I thought I knew them,” he said hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Virginia’s eyes avoided his. Her lips
were trembling, he thought. “I’ve had them a
long time. William—your brother—gave them to
me when I was just sixteen.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Daniel, looking up at the old
church, “how long ago they planted that English
ivy! There’s a perfect mantle of it, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Grandfather says the old rector planted it—the
one who married grandfather and grandmother
in this very church.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he did as much for my grandparents,”
said Daniel. “I wonder if they gave
him a good fee!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you lawyer!” cried Virginia, and laughed
happily.</p>

<p>But Daniel continued to look at the ivy. He had
seen her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“She still loves William,” he thought bitterly.</p>

<p>Virginia, hiding her confusion, began to ascend
the old stone steps.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s your father!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“I didn’t know that he often came this
way.”</p>

<p>Daniel, who was very pale again, looked around.</p>

<p>“He counted on walking down with me, I
fancy,” he remarked quietly, aware of the thunderstorm
in Mr. Carter’s face.</p>

<p>Virginia saw it, too, and made haste.</p>

<p>“I’m going in now. Good-by, Daniel, and remember—about
that next speech.”</p>

<p>He watched her as she went into the old church,
stopping at the door to wave a greeting to his
father. Framed thus, she made a picture that
he kept in his mind all the day and many days
thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter came up, a little out of breath and
very red.</p>

<p>“Going my way, father?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter slowed his steps to suit his lame
son’s gait. He was moody, and he had his morning
paper done up like a club in his hand. He
slashed viciously at the church snowball as they
reached it.</p>

<p>“My Lord, to think of that lovely girl—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
what I’ve got for a daughter-in-law!” he growled.</p>

<p>Daniel, who understood the process of his
father’s mind without asking any questions, said
nothing.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a nickelette-show, a ballet-dancer, a
runaway-with-a-gambler daughter-in-law, that’s
what I’ve got!”</p>

<p>They had reached the street now, and Daniel
checked him.</p>

<p>“Hush, father!” the young man said gently.
“Some one will hear you.”</p>

<p>“Hear me?” bawled Mr. Carter. “Hear me?
Drat it! D’you suppose the whole town doesn’t
know? I met Dr. Barbour when I came out of the
house just now. He says the Bulls, those new
people at the corner of Hill Street, brought her
home last night at one o’clock—I mean this morning—in
a motor. What d’you suppose they’ll
say?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ve got some sense and won’t say
anything,” suggested Daniel, thinking of the
prayer-book and Virginia’s face.</p>

<p>“They told Barbour, and he’ll tell every one—and
it isn’t twelve hours old.”</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything, father. Give the girl a
chance. William says it was an accident.”</p>

<p>“An accident? And your mother saw her flirting
with Corwin in the morning!” Mr. Carter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
could not restrain his ire. “I tell you, Dan, I
wouldn’t mind so much if William wasn’t behaving
like a lummox. He won’t get a divorce. He told
me so this morning.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens, why should he? It isn’t as
bad as that. She’s only a wild girl, and she hates
our ways. Why shouldn’t she? We’ve been finding
fault with her from the beginning. I don’t
see why you spoke of a divorce to William.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Mr. Carter set his teeth. Then, as
they got to the corner, he spoke his mind. “I
want him to get a divorce, behave like a gentleman,
and marry Virginia Denbigh—if she’ll have
him.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Virginia wouldn’t have him, if he got
a divorce to ask her,” said Daniel quietly. “She’s
not that kind of a woman.”</p>

<p>“She’s in love with him,” replied Mr. Carter;
“but I don’t care for that, either, if I can make
the fool shake off this—this wildcat!”</p>

<p>Daniel, who had reached Judge Jessup’s door,
smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry for the wildcat,” he said
quietly. “She’s alone, and she hasn’t a friend—unless
you count Leigh.”</p>

<p>“Leigh’s a ninny!” Mr. Carter retorted, and
went on, still storming, to his office.</p>

<p>But by twelve o’clock he had worked some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
his temper off. The process of cooling down began
and ended, too, in sympathy for William.
After all, it was hardest on William. He had been
a donkey, but he had—in common with the other
Carters—a natural horror of notoriety for his
women-folks.</p>

<p>Divorce and scandal! Mr. Carter, thinking
hard, could not recall a single case in his own
family. Of course Uncle Duff Carter had quarreled
with his wife, but it was about a back lot
that adjoined their place. He wanted to sow it
to oats for his horses, and his wife wanted to
keep it for a private burial-ground for the family.
There hadn’t been the least bit of scandal
about that quarrel, and it was made up before his
uncle died. He was buried, by the way, in that
same back lot, with a monument of Florentine
marble. His widow had her own way!</p>

<p>As for a runaway wife, or any kind of a wife
who wasn’t what Mr. Carter called “a lady,”
there was no record of it. William, his eldest son
and the pride of his heart, seemed about to make
the first break in a long line. It must distress
William as much as it did his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter began to feel the greatest compunction
about his son. The boy had behaved like a
donkey, but there was no use in crying over spilt
milk. The only way was to help him set it right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Of course, if the talk got no farther, and William
chose to forgive her and could keep her in hand,
there was nothing to be done about it.</p>

<p>As Mr. Carter’s rage against Fanchon began to
cool, he saw the advantage of suppressing the
scandal and making her behave. He had no very
clear idea of how this should be done, except his
firm belief that any sensible man could prevent
such doings in his own household. He belonged,
too, to a type of manhood that has long ago decided
on the simplest method to avenge an insult
to his family. He couldn’t recall an ancestor who
under such provocation would fail to shoot his
man. Times had changed now, but Mr. Carter
felt an intense desire to annihilate that brute,
Corwin.</p>

<p>He had no intention of mentioning this to William.
The cooling-off process had reached the
stage of common sense; but he felt that he must
talk things over with his son. He had experience
of life, if he had no experience with a recalcitrant
wife, and he wanted to suggest some kind of restraint
for his daughter-in-law. It seemed to him
a perfectly practical thing—because he had never
tried it. A moral strait-jacket for Fanchon appealed
to his mind, at the moment, more strongly
than any other idea in life.</p>

<p>He got through the morning’s work, lunched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
alone, and then waited until three o’clock. At that
time he could endure it no longer. He had caught
his two girl stenographers whispering, and he had
seen the office-boy watching the inn opposite,
where Corwin had stayed the day before. The
office-boy brought Mr. Carter’s resolution to a
head. He closed his desk sharply, snatched up his
hat, and started for William’s office.</p>

<p>The office was situated on the top floor of the
Payson Building. William was the buyer and
traveling agent of Mr. Payson’s chain of department-stores.
There was only a modest branch
store in the home town, but in larger cities there
were towering beehives bearing the name of
Payson.</p>

<p>William had traveled abroad for these stores,
and now, in his private office here, he was still
directing the foreign correspondence of the firm.
It was a position of great responsibility, and it
carried a handsome salary and perquisites. Mr.
Carter was proud of his son’s advance and proud
of his ability to keep up with it. It was his pride
in him that made this unfortunate marriage such
a bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>He passed through the crowded shop, glancing
at the long aisles of merchandise and noting the
rugs—some of them brought from Turkey by William,
others imported by his advice to be sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the larger markets in the North. At the elevator
Mr. Carter encountered Mr. Payson—the rich
man who had paid for the singers at the concert
where Fanchon had made herself notorious.</p>

<p>“I’m going up to see my son a moment,” said
Mr. Carter, as they shook hands.</p>

<p>Payson nodded, but he did not repeat his commendation
of William. Instead, he looked rather
odd and spoke about the weather.</p>

<p>“Fine for the crops,” he said; “but we need
more rain.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter assented. He felt uneasy. There
was something odd in Payson’s manner. The
magnate got off at the second floor, and the elevator
continued its ascent. At the top Mr. Carter
got out and hurried to his son’s door. As no one
answered his knock, he opened it and went in.</p>

<p>It was a good-sized office, furnished in accordance
with Mr. Payson’s ideas of business—that is,
in the latest and most solid fashion. On a table
in the center of the room stood a bottle and a glass,
and William Carter was stretched in a chair beside
it, lying half on the table, his head down,
sound asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter stood aghast. He could see the haggard
profile and the dark rings under the closed
eyes. Worn out with his heart-breaking night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
vigil, William had fallen asleep; but his father
felt that he was looking on the wreck of his son’s
life, that William, in his misery, had sought oblivion
in the old and time-honored way.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leigh Carter</span> had attained the dignity of his
eighteenth birthday a few days before the arrival
of his brother’s bride. He had done fairly well
at the high school, and was preparing now, during
vacation, for a preliminary examination for the
university which had educated the male Carters
for generations.</p>

<p>Leigh had some mental gifts and a taste for
poetry, which seemed to indicate a literary career,
and his fond mother regarded him as a budding
genius. There was a wide gap in age between the
two younger and the two older Carters, occasioned
by the death of three intervening children, and
Mrs. Carter’s affections had always centered on
her baby boy, as she still called Leigh—to his
great indignation. Her pride had been in William,
her sympathy for poor Dan, but her doting fondness
was for Leigh.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter did not approve of it. He had
warned her more than once that she couldn’t bring
up anything but an incubator chicken in that way
and make a success of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>Leigh wasn’t exactly a success. The latent
manhood in him had scarcely stirred. He was a
tall, lanky youth with a handsome, boyish face and
the eyes of a girl. He had been a dreamer, too,
and had spent much time in reading romances
from the news-stands; but he was a good boy, he
had cultivated no vices, and “milksop” was the
worst charge that other youths of his set could
make against him.</p>

<p>He had reached the impressionable age without
falling deeply in love, and his mind and heart happened
to be in a peculiarly receptive state when
Fanchon suddenly burst upon his vision. Her
beauty, the subtle charm and mystery of those
fawn-like eyes, and her caressing voice, captured
his youthful fancy. He could understand why William
loved her, and he became at once her slave
and worshiper. Then, when he saw the attitude of
the family revealed in pitiless criticism, he became
her still more devoted champion. Fanchon saw it,
and she coaxed the boy into still deeper infatuation.
It was her triumph to secure at least one
ally in a hostile family, and she used him as a
buffer. She always had a kind word for Leigh,
a soft pat of the hand, an errand which she conferred
as a favor. Leigh, immersed in romantic
visions, saw her as the loveliest and most persecuted
of beings, and he was ready to give battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
to the entire family in her behalf. As Emily expressed
it, he would have made himself into Sir
Walter Raleigh’s cloak for Fanchon to tread upon.</p>

<p>The storm that had followed upon her disappearance
on horseback had beaten upon Leigh’s
nerves. He had lashed himself into a dumb fury
in the solitude of his room because his father and
mother dared to doubt his paragon, and William,
her husband, merely sat and waited for her to
come back. William’s supineness was the last
straw. Leigh had been in a frenzy when Fanchon
finally returned, and the meeting on the stairs and
her soft kiss of gratitude had gone to his head. He
had refused to join a game of baseball that afternoon
because he wanted to go home and complete
a poem to his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Fanchon had sent him on an errand to the
nearest chemist. She had given him a prescription
for some headache powders, she said, and
Leigh did not know that he was returning with a
peculiarly effective preparation of “bloom” that
she usually applied at night. He carried the
package with something of the air and feeling with
which <i>Sir Lancelot</i> might have worn the colors of
<i>Elaine</i>.</p>

<p>It happened that his way led him past a corner
of the main street, where Mr. Bernstein had just
made special arrangements for showing Rosamond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Silvertree’s feature pictures at the little
local theater. Mr. Bernstein himself, in a new
plaid suit with a diamond scarf-pin, was viewing
a poster of Rosamond in the effective, if rather
startling, costume of “A Belle from Borneo.” He
had encountered Leigh on one or two previous occasions,
and knew him to be the youngest son of
Johnson Carter. As the boy approached, looking
a little pale from his night’s vigil, Mr. Bernstein
eyed him shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Looks like a regular moon-calf,” he thought;
“but I guess he’s got gumption enough to take a
warnin’ to the rest of ’em. Hello, young man!”
he called out. “Been in to see this picture? Greatest
picture on the screen! There’s a matinee to-day
and two showings to-night.”</p>

<p>Leigh shook his head, stopping to gaze in some
amazement at the highly colored portrait of the
fair Rosamond.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he remarked. “She’s fat!”</p>

<p>“Fat?” Mr. Bernstein blew his cheeks out and
stared at him with a kindling eye. “Fat, boy?
Why, she’s superb! That’s Rosamond Silvertree,
the most beautiful star on the screen!”</p>

<p>Leigh giggled. He giggled like a girl, a faint
pink color coming into his beardless cheeks, and
his girlish eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“How much do you suppose she weighs?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
asked gleefully. “Looks to me like four hundred
pounds—and some spangles!”</p>

<p>“Miss Silvertree’s a lady, young man!” retorted
Mr. Bernstein reprovingly. “She’s got one
of the finest figures I ever saw. Spangles? I want
you to know that there’s one scene where she’s got
on the fetchingest costume—five yards of chiffon
and fifteen pounds of crystal spangles! It’s
beauty, classic beauty, on the screen.”</p>

<p>Leigh suppressed a giggle this time, and only
smiled inanely, edging away.</p>

<p>“Looks kinder foolish,” Mr. Bernstein reflected,
but he laid a detaining hand on Leigh’s arm. “See
here, you’re Leigh Carter, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>Leigh nodded. He half expected an offer for
the screen, and he lingered, coloring like a girl.</p>

<p>“Then I guess I can say a word to you—confidential,
you understand?” Mr. Bernstein winked
slowly. “Entirely confidential—between gentlemen,
see?” he added with a stroke of inspiration.</p>

<p>Leigh, flattered in spite of himself, nodded. Mr.
Bernstein linked an arm in his.</p>

<p>“Step this way,” he said casually. “Don’t
want to attract attention. Now, Mr. Carter——”
He paused, allowing the formal address to sink in.
It did. Leigh straightened up. “There’s a fellow
over at the inn named Corwin. Heard of him?”</p>

<p>Leigh’s color deepened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“I think so,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein nodded.</p>

<p>“He’s Caraffi’s manager. Caraffi’s up at the
Hot Springs, taking baths to reduce his flesh, or
to make his hair grow, and Corwin’s killing time
down here. Now I ain’t meaning any offense.
I’m speaking as a friend, you understand? This
man, Corwin, he ain’t a gentleman. He’s a sport
an’ a gambler an’ a loafer. He ain’t any nearer
being a gentleman than that there lamp-post’s
near being a brindled cow. He gets full, too, and
when he does he talks, see?”</p>

<p>Leigh, beginning to suspect the drift of the talk,
was becoming furious.</p>

<p>“I take no interest in Mr. Corwin,” he said
sharply. “If that’s all you’ve got to say, Mr.
Bernstein——”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” said Mr. Bernstein impatiently.
“I’ve got to tell one of your family—for the sake
of the lady. If you want to protect your sister-in-law
from scandal, Mr. Leigh Carter, you’d
better listen. I ain’t believing the talk myself, but
it ain’t my business. If it was, I’d lam the feller
good an’ plenty!”</p>

<p>Leigh stared at him. He did not want to listen,
but he was boy enough to want to hear. He
breathed rather short.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, Mr. Bernstein,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
he cried excitedly. “I won’t hear talk of my sister-in-law!”</p>

<p>“Say!” Bernstein tapped his shoulder with a
fat forefinger. “Ain’t it better for you Carters
to hear it than the whole town? I ask you that?
Ain’t it up to you Carters to shut his mouth?”</p>

<p>Leigh faltered, then he set his young teeth
hard and flung his head back.</p>

<p>“What does he dare to say about Mrs. William
Carter?” he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>“I ain’t telling you all he says,” Mr. Bernstein
replied meaningly. “I ain’t soiling my mouth
with it—he’s a bad one! But he’s saying now—to-day—that
she started to run away with him
yesterday, and then got scared an’ come back at
one o’clock in the mornin’—”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!” cried Leigh. “A black lie!
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said Mr. Bernstein. “You’re a boy.
Don’t you go lookin’ for him. You tell your
father, Leigh Carter. He had oughter know
it, he—say!”</p>

<p>Leigh had torn himself away and dashed off
at a pace that left Mr. Bernstein gasping.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m darned!” he exclaimed. Then he
relaxed, and stood looking after Leigh with something
like satisfaction. “I guess he’ll tell ’em.
They wouldn’t listen to me, and that Corwin—something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> 
oughter be done to him. He ain’t no
gentleman!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein walked slowly and thoughtfully
back to the “Belle from Borneo” poster. He felt
that he had done his duty. He bore no ill-will to
little Fanchon la Fare, and he hated Corwin.</p>

<p>Leigh, meanwhile, turned off the main street
into the quiet lane behind the church and stopped
to think. He stopped, panting, on the very step
where Virginia had stood talking with Dan. His
hot young blood was beating in his head with a
noise like a sledge-hammer. Fury choked him.
He remembered his own hours of anguished suspense
last night, Fanchon’s return after her accident,
and her light kiss on his cheek. Her knight
had received his accolade; he would not fail her!</p>

<p>Sitting under the old tree where the scarlet-headed
woodpecker had bored a neat hole, Leigh
made up his mind. Bernstein had told the truth
about Corwin—that he knew. He couldn’t doubt
Bernstein. The little man’s earnestness had been
apparent.</p>

<p>Corwin must be dealt with. Leigh Carter would
deal with him, too, at once. He was no child to
run to his father. Besides, his father didn’t like
Fanchon. Lately he had thought his father an
unjust man.</p>

<p>As for William—Leigh remembered William’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
supine waiting last night. Leigh did not mean to
wait now. He would carry out the thing he had
in mind.</p>

<p>He had read once of a man like Corwin slandering
a noble lady. The hero—Leigh’s favorite
hero, by the way—had seized a horse-pistol, ridden
fifty miles on a mustang, confronted the villain,
held his pistol to his head, and forced him to write
and sign a retraction that made the lady’s character
shine out as clear as noonday. Getting his
breath on the old stone step of the church where
he had been baptized, Leigh made up his mind as
swiftly as the mustang had galloped. He took off
his hat, wiped the drops of perspiration from his
boyish forehead, and, straightening his collar and
tie, rose and went straight home.</p>

<p>It happened at the moment that there was no
one in the house but Miranda and his mother. As
he entered, he heard his mother’s voice in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Miranda, get me those pitted cherries. I’m
going to make a pie for dinner. Leigh loves cherry
pie!”</p>

<p>He paused with his hand on the banister, thrilled
with that poignant moment. Unknown to Mrs.
Carter, her son was about to act a man’s great
part, to avenge the honor of the family, and she—oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
grotesque thought—she was making cherry
pie for him!</p>

<p>But he could not wait even for such thoughts as
these. He ran up-stairs and into his father’s
room. In the upper draw of the old mahogany
highboy was a pistol. Mr. Carter kept it loaded
as a precaution against mythical burglars. Leigh
found it, thrust it in his pocket, and walked slowly
down the hall.</p>

<p>Fanchon’s door was open. She had gone out,
but she had left the room in sweet confusion. He
caught sight of the trailing silk and chiffon of her
tea-gown—one of the family amazements—lying
across the bed. On a chair hung her riding-jacket,
left to dry. There was an elusive fragrance of
violets, the same fragrance that always hung about
her person. Evidently she had forgotten her headache,
or she had gone out to walk it off.</p>

<p>Very reverently Leigh laid the chemist’s package
on a chair near the door. Then he saw a small
glove lying on the floor. He picked it up, kissed
it solemnly, and thrust it into his pocket. The
illusion was complete—he bore his lady’s glove.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Aristide Corwin was alone in his room at the
inn. It happened that his open windows commanded
a clear view of Mr. Carter’s office opposite,
and of the sign over the door—“Johnson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Carter, Insurance and Loans.” Corwin had been
staring at it moodily. He hated it for some
reason.</p>

<p>Not that he thought much of the Carters. His
business was with Fanchon, not with William
Carter. But he hated that office, and he hated the
whole tribe, at the moment, because Fanchon had
outwitted him. She had made a fool of him. He
had had his revenge, he was making the town ring
with his talk, but he was not even with her yet—not
yet! His eyes kindled fiercely at the thought
of her. He had been drinking. Two bottles still
stood on his table, and his glass was full.</p>

<p>He was a man who had been handsome in his
first youth, but his face had coarsened and his
hard eyes lowered. He rose, stripped off his
coat, and sat down again in his shirt-sleeves, his
collar unbuttoned from his big throat. He was
hot, but he kept on drinking. It was late now,
near supper-time, and there came a knock at his
door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he said harshly.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Leigh Carter entered.
Corwin did not know him, he did not remember
having seen him with Fanchon, but he saw a slender
boy of seventeen or eighteen, well-dressed and
deathly pale, with the eyes of a girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“What do you want, kid?” he demanded
sharply, setting down his glass.</p>

<p>Leigh walked straight across the room to the
table and stood looking down at him, an image of
young scorn and wrath.</p>

<p>“I’m Leigh Carter,” he said, breathing quickly.
“I’ve heard the infamous story you’re telling
about a lady—my sister-in-law, Mrs. William Carter—a
story that she ran away with you last night.
I’m here to demand the truth. Did you—did you
dare to tell such a story here?”</p>

<p>Corwin’s first stare of surprise gave way to a
slow, insulting grin. He measured Leigh from
head to foot. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied truculently. “I did say that—and
a damned sight more, Mr. Leigh Carter—kid.
And it’s every bit true!”</p>

<p>Leigh’s hands shook as he grasped the edge
of the table.</p>

<p>“You’ll take that back, Mr. Corwin,” he said
in a low voice, leaning forward and looking at the
man opposite.</p>

<p>Corwin laughed, tilting his chair and putting his
feet on the table. His very nonchalance stung the
boy opposite with a fresh sense of insult.</p>

<p>“Will I?” he mocked. “Who’s going to make
me do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Leigh, white with passion now, flashed scorn
upon him.</p>

<p>“I will! You can’t say things like that about
my brother’s wife!”</p>

<p>Corwin stared at him, still laughing; then he
lowered his feet to the floor and rose. Standing,
he overtopped the slender Carter boy by half a
head.</p>

<p>“Your brother’s wife, eh?” he sneered. “Look
here, child, you go home and eat your supper.
Don’t you get worked up over Fanchon. I’ve
known the lady quite a spell. If I whistled”—Mr.
Corwin threw his head back and walked across
the room toward Leigh, flushed with liquor, truculent,
intolerable—“if I whistled, she’d run off
with me to-morrow. I don’t because”—he came
closer to Leigh now, laughing and sneering, insult
in every line of his coarse, flushed face—“because
I don’t want her!”</p>

<p>Leigh swung around and faced him, shaking
with rage.</p>

<p>“You lie!” he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>Corwin only laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>“You fool kid, you don’t know the lady.
She——”</p>

<p>He leaned over, thrust his face close to Leigh’s
and whispered. The boy sprang back.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he almost shrieked. “I’ll fight you!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
I’m a Carter, and I challenge you to fight a duel!”</p>

<p>The man laughed loudly again.</p>

<p>“A duel with you? You kid!”</p>

<p>“Yes, with me!” Leigh trembled with passion.
“You’ve got to fight—I’ll send my seconds. You’re
a coward, sir, and a liar!”</p>

<p>Corwin caught him suddenly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“See here, you Carter boy!” said he. “You’ve
called me a liar twice to-day. I’m not a liar—I’ll
show you! Fight duels for that woman? Bah!
I don’t fight kids—I box their ears!”</p>

<p>He sneered and slapped Leigh’s face. The boy,
with a cry of passion and shame, wrenched himself
free, snatched the pistol from his pocket, and
fired pointblank.</p>

<p>The noise of the report rang in his own ears with
a deafening crash, and there was a little whiff of
smoke. Leigh reeled back, his horrified eyes fixed
on the floor.</p>

<p>Corwin had crumpled up like a sack of meal and
lay there in a heap, stone dead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato</span> was removing the tray from the wicker
table in the garden. The colonel, sitting under
his horse-chestnut, observed the operation
thoughtfully, smoking one of his big cigars.</p>

<p>“Yessuh, if yo’ wants to buy a horse yo’ can
hab it cheap—dat’s what Job Wills says. He was
down to Miz Carter’s dis mornin’ talkin’ to dat
yaller girl, Mirandy. She done tole me. It am
a good horse, col’nel, only got dat habit ob rollin’
in de water.”</p>

<p>“Pretty bad habit, Plato,” observed the colonel.
“Don’t know as I’d like to have Miss Jinny rolled
into the water.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what happened to Miz Wilyum Carter,
suh. She got rolled in de creek, an’ she didn’t get
home till round one o’clock in de mornin’. Mirandy,
she say Mist’ Carter, he mos’ throw a fit.
Dat’s de reason de livery-stable done wanter sell
dat horse. Job Wills, he say he’s good horse, but
he’s de rollin’est horse he ever see—in a stream.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked thoughtfully at the end of
his cigar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Suppose I bought him, Plato? How about the
rolling habit?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t noffin’ ter dat, suh, but to keep him out’n
de water. I ’members ole Col’nel Colfax, suh, he
done had dat horse, Pole Star, son ob de ole Black
Star, suh, dat won all dem races. Mighty fine
horse! De col’nel couldn’t ride dat horse ’less
dere was a drought. Sho! He sen’ him down to de
races every year. I reckon dat horse wins more
races den any odder horse in dis country, yessuh!
Yo’ ’member old Judge Berrien?” Plato began
to shake with reminiscent laughter. “Yessuh, dat
ole man mighty mean to Col’nel Colfax. Yessuh,
he comes up to dinner one night, an’ he wants to
ride home. He was allus borrowin’ horses, an’ he
mighty slow ’bout returnin’ ’em. Didn’t never
own no horse, but he was allus ridin’. De col’nel,
he fuss ’bout a bit, den he calls out loud: ‘Heah,
yo’, August!’ August was de col’nel’s groom.
‘Yo’, August, bring ’round Pole Star!’ It had
been rainin’ in de mornin’ an’ de creek was all up
to de bridge. De judge, he mighty pleased to ride
Pole Star. He ain’t been gone long befo’ de
col’nel, he say: ‘August, yo’ go down to de creek.
I reckon de judge wants to return dat horse.’
August, he went,” Plato chuckled. “Pole Star,
he was rollin’ in dat creek, suh. August, he say
he look ’round, don’ see noffin’, den he see de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
judge. Fo’ de Lawd, suh, August, he declar’ he
done thought it was one ob dese yere doodle-bugs
jus’ up outen de groun’ wid its legs all mud. De
judge, he got in de water an’ den he got in de
mud. He say: ‘Yo’ take dat damned horse back
to Col’nel Colfax, an’ yo’ tell him I ain’t ridin’
no porpuses!’”</p>

<p>The colonel laughed.</p>

<p>“Plato,” he said, “I don’t think I’ll buy Job
Wills’s horse for Miss Jinny—not after that!”</p>

<p>Plato wagged his head.</p>

<p>“I done tole Mirandy dat I was sho’ yo’ won’t
buy no sech horse, suh.” Then, as he finally took
up the tray, he added: “Miss Jinny say to tell
yo’-all she done ask Mist’ Dan’l Carter to dinner,
suh.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was so late, Plato. Where’s
Miss Virginia?”</p>

<p>“She an’ Mist’ Dan’l in de parlor, suh. Miss
Jinny, she been playin’ fo’ him. She step out an’
tell me to tell yo’ she ask him to dinner.”</p>

<p>“You get out a bottle of the old Burgundy,
Plato,” said the colonel, and then added hastily:
“Oh, no, I forgot—he doesn’t drink anything but
water. But, all the same, I like Mr. Daniel.”</p>

<p>“Yessuh,” said Plato. “Mighty good lawyer.
I done heah Judge Jessup say he wouldn’t wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
if Mist’ Dan’l git to be Pres’dent United States
hisself!”</p>

<p>The colonel laughed. Then he rose slowly to his
full height, ran his fingers through his white hair,
and started for the house. He was going in to
see Daniel. He liked to talk to him. But, as he
entered the wide, old hall, he heard the soft strains
of Virginia’s music. He stopped involuntarily to
listen. She was playing an old tune, a love-song
that the colonel loved. Virginia’s grandmother
had played it to him.</p>

<p>The old man stood listening, his eyes dreaming.
Music is the most poignant of all reminders. The
old hall was the same into which he had led his
bride so many years ago. There was Grandfather
Denbigh’s clock in the corner, with the sun and
the moon and the stars inlaid on its dial. There
was the high chair in which one Governor Denbigh
had sat. Things were shabby, the rug under his
feet was frayed, but the dear familiarity of it all
moved his heart.</p>

<p>He felt a lump in his throat, and tried in vain
to swallow it. Without disturbing Virginia’s playing,
he moved to the door of the drawing-room
and looked in.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o’clock in the evening, and the
western sun shone warmly in the wide window behind
the piano. It warmed and mellowed every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
object in the quaint, old-fashioned room. It
touched on the dull gold frame of General Denbigh’s
portrait painted by Peale; it showed the
tall harpsichord by the chimney-place, and the
quaint, spindle-legged chairs with their shabby
damask seats. The walls, mellowed by time, had
the ruddy tints that form a background for old
pictures and dull furniture.</p>

<p>The sunshine caught a corner of the mahogany
table and glinted on a cabinet that held Captain
Denbigh’s corals, collected long ago in the South
Seas; but it did more than that. It touched the
golden hair on Virginia’s head and illuminated
the delicate beauty of her unconscious profile, her
simple white dress, her slender wrists, and her
white hands.</p>

<p>The colonel looked at her fondly. He thought
her the loveliest girl in the State. He was on the
point of entering softly, to draw up a chair and
listen, when his eyes lighted on Daniel Carter.</p>

<p>Daniel, the lame brother of William, Daniel the
unobtrusive, had not heard Colonel Denbigh. He
sat with his profile also turned toward the door,
leaning a little forward, one elbow on the lame
knee, the other hand resting on the arm of his
chair, and his pale face turned toward Virginia.
Unconsciously she played, unconscious of an observer,
and Daniel watched her. His dark eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
followed her movements as her delicate fingers
swept the keys, and his own hand tightened on the
arm of his chair until the knuckles whitened.</p>

<p>The colonel, watching him, had no longer any
doubt that Daniel shared his admiration of Virginia.
Something in the tense young face made
the colonel turn quietly away, and walk soberly
out on the front piazza.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll smoke another cigar before dinner,”
he said to himself. “Poor boy, it’s a pity
he’s lame. And, Jinny? Well, Jinny liked his
brother.”</p>

<p>The colonel lit his cigar and tramped rather
heavily up and down the piazza.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Virginia played on to the end of
the piece; then she turned and looked over her
shoulder. Meeting Daniel’s eyes, she felt again
that sudden shyness that she had felt before the
church, and she laughed tremulously.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what old Dr. Samuel Johnson
said about music, Dan?” she asked lightly.
“I was thinking of it just now. He said that it
excited no new ideas in his mind, and prevented
him from contemplating his own.”</p>

<p>“Very like him,” said Daniel. “He never saw
anything but his own ideas. I’ll admit that it
stops me from contemplating mine—I contemplate
you instead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Virginia laughed gaily this time.</p>

<p>“I shall play for you no more, then. Your ideas
are worth too much. Lucas told me this morning,
as we drove out from town, that Judge Jessup expects
you to be ‘Pres’dent United States, yessuh.’”</p>

<p>Daniel reddened.</p>

<p>“I wish the judge wouldn’t make me appear
such a fool. He’s always talking; he’s like your
old Samuel Johnson.”</p>

<p>“I think he knows what he’s talking about,
Dan,” she replied gently, her serious eyes on his
thin face. “You’re working too hard; ambition’s
eating you up. Why, Dan, how thin you’ve
grown!”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“I know it. The judge asked me, not long
ago, if I had the pip.”</p>

<p>They both laughed this time.</p>

<p>“Daniel,” said Virginia irrelevantly, “I heard
you were going into politics. Mr. Payson told me
that you were standing for nomination for the
Legislature.”</p>

<p>He nodded, regarding her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It seems strange, Dan,” she observed after a
moment. “I never thought you cared for that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p>“What sort of thing, Virginia?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Politics.” She paused and smiled at him a
little, her color rising. “I thought you were a
kind of poet.”</p>

<p>“You’re thinking of Leigh; he’s our infant
genius. I’m only a stodgy lawyer.”</p>

<p>Daniel leaned back in his chair, thinking. His
eyes, traveling over Virginia’s bright head, rested
suddenly on a little portrait of a baby boy that
hung above her piano in an oval frame. He recognized
it with a grim tightening of the lips. It was
an old picture of William at the tender age of
three. His mother had given it to Virginia when
she thought Virginia was to be William’s wife.
Doubtless it was an awkward thing to give back,
and perhaps—Daniel did not finish the thought.</p>

<p>“I’m going into politics if I can,” he said dryly.
“I’ve got to have some interest, Virginia. A
cripple can’t sit still and think about being a
cripple.”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t dwell so much on that,”
she rejoined quickly. “You think too much of it.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t speak of it often,” he replied bitterly.
“I try to hold my tongue.”</p>

<p>“You scarcely ever speak of it, Daniel,” she
assured him gently. “I’m glad you spoke of it to
me, though. I take it as a compliment.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>He spoke sharply, his brows down. Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
gave him a clear, sweet look that made him wince
with misery—though she did not know it.</p>

<p>“Because I’m sure you wouldn’t speak of it at
all if you didn’t believe that I felt for you; that I
was your friend.”</p>

<p>He drew a quick breath, pressing his lips together.
There was a moment of silence; then he
laughed discordantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you! I remember how you took
that maimed dog home when you were a child. All
the others wanted it killed. I can see your eyes
blaze now. How you fought for him! He had a
right to live, you said. You always felt for the
halt and the blind.”</p>

<p>“That dog was a comfort,” returned Virginia
stoutly. “It wasn’t any merit to be good to him.
He was the best watch-dog we ever had.”</p>

<p>“No one but you would have nursed that ugly,
old, lame dog. It’s your pity, Virginia—that’s
what I’m trading on—when I talk of my lameness.”</p>

<p>Virginia rose suddenly from the piano and came
over to his side. Before he knew what she was
going to do, she had laid one of her firm young
hands on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said sternly. “You’re getting
embittered; you’re losing the proportion of things,
Daniel. If you talk like that I shall not pity you;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
I shall not even be your friend. Remember the
gifts you’ve got, the brains God has given you.
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Daniel Carter?”</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment. He sat quite
still, looking up into her face soberly, aware of her
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“What am I to do if I can’t help feeling that
way, Virginia?” he asked at last in a low voice.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t; I forbid you!” she said quickly,
but she faltered.</p>

<p>She had come to him with the impulse of a sister;
she had felt herself a sister to Daniel so long.
There was no coquetry in it, only her sympathy
for him. She knew how he had suffered. But now,
suddenly, meeting his uplifted eyes, Virginia became
self-conscious. She blushed, and her hand
fell from his shoulder. With almost a feeling of
panic she retraced her steps and sank back upon
the piano-stool.</p>

<p>Daniel, leaning back in his chair as she had left
him, passed his hand over his eyes. He was breathing
with difficulty, like a man in pain, although he
never suffered now from his injury. The physical
pain was long past, and only the lameness remained;
but for a moment he breathed like a man
in anguish. Then, as his hand fell heavily on the
arm of his chair, he raised his head and looked at
her with haggard eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Don’t do that again, Virginia,” he said in a
low voice. “I can’t bear it!”</p>

<p>That was all he said, but Virginia, meeting his
eyes, turned pale. She seemed to see suddenly, as
if she looked into a mirror, all those days when she
and William had been so happy and so foolish together,
and Daniel—suffering from his hurt then—had
looked on.</p>

<p>She knew now what he had suffered; and she had
never once thought of him! It filled her with generous
shame. What could she do? What could
she say to him?</p>

<p>Then she heard his voice.</p>

<p>“Virginia, please play that last tune over again.
I love it. It’s so tranquil,” he said gently.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his in gratitude. He had
known what to do, how to make it easy for her.
He had not misjudged her; had not thought her a
mere flirt.</p>

<p>She turned to the piano with an effort, winking
back her tears; but she began to play, softly at
first, with one little discord, then firmly, with a
sure touch, as her heart grew more calm and she
seemed to feel the reassurance of his friendship
and understanding.</p>

<p>She was still playing when the telephone-bell
rang sharply, its strident alarm shattering the last
sweet cadences. Startled in spite of herself, Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
rose hastily and went to the cabinet where
the instrument stood.</p>

<p>“It’s some one inquiring if you are here, Dan,”
she said in surprise. “Some one—your father, I
think it is—wants to speak to you.”</p>

<p>Daniel rose slowly—with unusual effort, she
thought—and took the receiver from her hand.
Virginia returned to the piano, busying herself
there, turning over the leaves of her music, and
trying not to listen; but she heard him ask a quick
question. Then he uttered a sharp exclamation,
and involuntarily she looked up.</p>

<p>Daniel hung up the receiver and turned.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, what is it? What has happened?”
she cried.</p>

<p>His white lips moved soundlessly at first.</p>

<p>“It’s my young brother,” he said at last.
“Leigh has shot and killed that man—Corwin,
Caraffi’s manager.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was after dark, and the lights at the station-house
were shining across a street still crowded
with the curious and the idle, when Daniel finally
reached the little cell where Leigh had been lodged
since the shooting. He found the boy lying face
downward on the bare cot in the corner, his head
on his arms. Daniel had to touch his shoulder before
he roused himself and looked up. His white,
drawn face and his disheveled hair shocked his
brother. He looked as if he had aged two years in
five hours.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to help you, Leigh,” said Daniel
simply.</p>

<p>Leigh raised himself to a sitting posture, dropping
his feet heavily to the floor. Daniel saw
the traces of tears on his blurred face, but he
pulled himself together, though his lips shook.</p>

<p>“Are they going to keep me here all night?”
he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>Daniel sat down beside him on the cot.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so, Leigh. Father offered bail,
and so did Judge Jessup, but I don’t think you’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
get out to-night.” He laid his hand kindly on his
brother’s shoulder. “Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>Leigh’s face worked convulsively, and he set
his teeth hard on his lower lip. Daniel waited, his
hand still on the boy’s shoulder, his eyes immeasurably
kind. He did not blame Leigh, and
he was shocked at the change in him. It was a
subtle thing, but it was there—that shot had killed
Leigh’s boyhood. Daniel saw it.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before Leigh could speak.</p>

<p>“I—I never saw any one die before, Dan!” he
said at last, swallowing hard.</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty tragic thing, Leigh,” agreed
Daniel. “I never saw any one die like that myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord—he looked so terrible!” cried Leigh,
covering his face with his slender, shaking, boyish
hands. “I’ll—I’ll never forget it!”</p>

<p>He fell to shuddering, in a state of collapse.
Daniel patted his shoulder kindly and waited. The
boy would have to tell it his own way. It seemed
a long time, though, and the dim light in the cell
flared up and down.</p>

<p>Daniel looked about the narrow chamber; it was
barren and dirty and exceedingly oppressive. He
thought of his mother. This was her baby, her
darling boy, the one she believed to be the coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
genius of the family. It moved Daniel with infinite
compassion and indignation.</p>

<p>Leigh lifted his haggard face from his hands
and looked at his brother.</p>

<p>“Will they hang me, Dan?” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Not while I can lift a voice in your defense,
Leigh; not while there’s any power on earth that
your brother can move to save you!” cried Daniel
his own voice deepening with emotion. “I’m your
lawyer now, dear boy. Tell me about it. I’ve
got to know. They say you went up to Corwin’s
room; that he was half drunk and unarmed, and
you shot him in cold blood.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he was unarmed!” cried Leigh
passionately. “You know I didn’t, Dan. I had
to shoot him. He was belying Fanchon; he dared
to talk ill of Fanchon——”</p>

<p>“Leave Fanchon out!” cried Daniel. “Forget
her for five minutes. Think of yourself, Leigh,
of your own defense. Tell me about that shot.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I had to shoot him!” Leigh’s young
face was distorted; a man’s fury looked out of his
young eyes. “I’d shoot him again this minute if
he stood there”—he pointed a shaking finger at
the wall opposite—“and said such things of Fanchon!”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, leave Fanchon out! How
did you do it, Leigh! I’m going to save you, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
will save you, but you must tell me. Forget that
I’m your brother, remember that I’m your lawyer.
Tell me the whole story, Leigh.”</p>

<p>Leigh, still choking with wrath, tried to command
himself.</p>

<p>“I was going home this afternoon,” he began
hoarsely, “and Bernstein—you know, the movie
man—he met me and told me to tell father about
this—this man, Corwin.”</p>

<p>Daniel suppressed an exclamation.</p>

<p>“He had no right to tell a boy like you.”</p>

<p>“I had a right to hear, Dan,” Leigh cried with
passionate emphasis. “I’m the only one who
cares for Fanchon——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Daniel roughly. “Where’s
William? You forget William.”</p>

<p>Leigh set his face hard.</p>

<p>“Not even William! Didn’t he sit and wait for
her to come home that night? Do you think I’d
do such a thing? Do you think any man would
do such a thing if he loved a woman?”</p>

<p>Leigh was aflame now, and Daniel was silent.
Like a flash arose the picture of William and Virginia.
He had felt sure for a long time that William
had repented in dust and ashes. The boy was
right; no man who loved a woman would have sat
there and waited that night.</p>

<p>“Corwin was insulting my sister-in-law,” Leigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
went on. “He was lying about her and blackening
her. I wouldn’t stand for it. I didn’t wait to tell
father. Father has never been just to her. I
went home and got his pistol. I was going to hold
it to Corwin’s head and make him write a retraction—that’s
what I went there to do!”</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head mournfully. He recognized
the familiar methods of the heroes of light
fiction and the movies. Leigh had been acting a
story, or, rather, he had started to act a story, and
had failed. How in the world could he get this
side of it—before a jury?</p>

<p>“What did Corwin say? What did he do when
you got there, Leigh? What made you shoot an
unarmed man?”</p>

<p>Leigh winced. His brother’s tone, and the bald
statement of an ugly fact, drove the truth home,
but he set his teeth hard, scowling into space for
a moment. The change in him moved Daniel
again. Leigh had been a boy in the morning; to-night
he had killed a man!</p>

<p>“I’ve told you,” he said hoarsely. “I shot him
for his lies about Fanchon. I—I had to shoot him,
Dan. He wasn’t fit to live!”</p>

<p>As Leigh spoke, he flung his arm out with a
gesture of passionate fury. Daniel caught the
arm and held it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Leigh, tell me the whole of it. I’m your lawyer—do
you hear?”</p>

<p>Something in Daniel, his strength and his will,
conquered, and the younger brother yielded to it.
He drew a quick breath and straightened himself,
feeling the clasp of Daniel’s hand on his arm.
Then he told his story—told it from the beginning
to the end, his voice only breaking a little.</p>

<p>“I suppose he died right away,” he said as he
finished. “He didn’t move any more. He deserved
it—but, oh Lord, Dan! I don’t want to
see another man die because I shot him! Maybe
I’m a coward, but I don’t!”</p>

<p>“You’re no coward,” replied Daniel quietly.
“It’s a trying thing to see even a brute like that
die, I reckon.” He glanced at the boy’s face and
hesitated. “We’re going to put up a big fight,
Leigh.”</p>

<p>Leigh’s mouth twisted oddly; he was trying to
keep his lips from shaking.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can stand for it, Dan. Mother——”
He looked at his brother.</p>

<p>“You’ll see her soon. You know how she loves
you. We’re all behind you, boy!”</p>

<p>Dan rose as he spoke. He hated to leave Leigh,
but it was inevitable. He stood looking down at
him, aware that Leigh winked back fresh tears
at the thought of his mother. But the prisoner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
thoughts shifted elsewhere. He looked up shyly,
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“And Fanchon?”</p>

<p>Daniel’s face hardened.</p>

<p>“She’s locked in her room, Leigh, and won’t
see any of us. She treats us like enemies now.
She hasn’t even asked where you are.”</p>

<p>Leigh’s face went from red to white.</p>

<p>“She’d see me, though!” he cried with conviction.
“You don’t understand—you don’t know
her!”</p>

<p>Daniel said nothing to this, and there was a
little pause, while his intolerable opinion of Fanchon
seemed to thicken the very atmosphere the
angry boy was breathing. Leigh’s eyes flashed,
and he hit his lip hard, but his elder brother held
out his hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go now.”</p>

<p>There was a break in Daniel’s voice. His other
arm went around the prisoner’s shoulders. Leigh
broke down at the touch, and the brothers clung
together.</p>

<p>Then Daniel tore himself away.</p>

<p>“We’ll get you out of this, Leigh—God bless
you!”</p>

<p>A moment more and Daniel got out into the
corridor, where he stumbled blindly, dashing tears
from his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>The turnkey, locking the door of the cell, was
startled.</p>

<p>“Anything the matter, sir?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” said Daniel, swallowing the lump
in his throat. “Nothing!”</p>

<p>He made his way hastily out of the station-house.</p>

<p>He did not stop even to confer with Judge
Jessup. They had already covered most of the
case in their previous talks; the morning would
do for Judge Jessup. It was late, and Daniel
wanted to reassure Mrs. Carter. He was horribly
sorry for his mother. There seemed no way to
comfort her. She was fairly stunned by the blow,
and she could only keep on crying out that Leigh
was a child, nothing but a child!</p>

<p>Daniel walked slowly at first. He did not want
people to think that he was slinking home because
his brother was in the station-house, charged with
murder. The main street of the town was quiet
enough at that hour, but it was evident that there
was suppressed excitement. Little groups were
gathered here and there along his way from the
station-house, and men stopped talking to observe
him covertly as he passed.</p>

<p>The story of Fanchon and Corwin had been magnified
by this time until it bore no resemblance
to its original form. Scandal is an ugly thing, fed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
usually by falsehood and growing like a dirty
snowball rolled up in a coal-yard. Daniel perceived
the curious faces, and was aware of the
hush as he approached. Here and there a man
took pains to speak to him in sign of open sympathy,
but not often.</p>

<p>The long, pleasant street was rather dim under
the arching trees, except where a lance of light
shot across it from a street-lantern, or the headlight
of a passing motor illuminated it broadly
for a moment. The inn opposite his father’s office
was still brilliant for some belated diners, and he
was aware that two or three of the waiters came
to the door to stare at him as he went by. In the
room over their heads Corwin had been shot to
death by his brother—only a few hours before.
But he noticed that a Victrola was grinding out a
rag-time record in the dining-room in spite of it.</p>

<p>He was glad that the next turn took him through
the church lane into the old street that led to his
father’s house. Here only an occasional light
shone in the houses, standing far apart and surrounded
by their old-fashioned gardens, and there
were few passers-by.</p>

<p>Daniel slackened his pace, partly because his
lameness always troubled him when he was weary,
and partly because he wanted to order his
thoughts. He found it hard, for he was visited by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
a vision of Virginia standing in the open door
of her home, holding his hand, her eyes full of
sympathy—for Leigh!</p>

<p>At his own gate Daniel paused and looked up at
the sky. The moon was just rising with an extraordinary
beauty. The upper sky looked like a
silver sea, pierced here and there by a brilliant
star, and against it the dark hills rose in sharpened
outlines, silhouetted against the ineffable sky. It
had been so yesterday; it would be so to-morrow.</p>

<p>The unchangeable forces of nature seemed to
reach Daniel with a new and bitter truth. Things
would continue in spite of their little tragedy,
even life would go on just the same—except for
the coarse man lying dead with Leigh’s bullet in
his heart!</p>

<p>He was a long time finding his latch-key, he
felt so reluctant to open the door. But, as the
lock clicked, his mother appeared at the threshold
of the drawing-room, and he saw that she was
shaking all over.</p>

<p>“Oh, Danny!” In emotion she always reverted
to the baby names of her children. “Oh, Danny,
didn’t you bring him home. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t bring him to-night, mother.” Daniel
laid his hand kindly on her arm. “He’s all right—I’ve
just been with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>She looked at him in horror, tears welling up
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“He—he isn’t in jail?” she whispered in a faint
voice, clutching at Daniel’s sleeve.</p>

<p>He put his arm around her.</p>

<p>“No, mother—he’s in the station-house, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>She uttered a cry, burying her face on his shoulder.
Emily appeared behind her, in a state of dishevelment,
her nose and eyes hopelessly red.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she warned them. “William hasn’t
stopped tramping up and down the back piazza.
I think he’s going crazy, and it’s got into his legs
first. Honest, I do, Dan!”</p>

<p>Daniel made no reply to this, partly because his
father had just emerged from the library. Mr.
Carter had been busy all the afternoon trying to
get his son out on bail. He was worn out, and
looked it. His iron-gray hair was standing up in
a frill on the top of his head, and his cheeks looked
flabby. He had taken off his coat and his boots,
and stood there in his shirt-sleeves and stockinged
feet.</p>

<p>“Did they take bail?” he asked grimly, looking
at Dan over the top of the reading-glasses, which
he had forgotten to take off.</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head, and, without another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
word, Mr. Carter turned and went back into the
library.</p>

<p>“She’s up there—locked in her room,” Mrs.
Carter whispered between sobs on her son’s shoulder.
“She won’t even see William, and she’s had
her supper sent up. I don’t see how she could
eat it, after what she’s done!” And she wept
again, clinging to Daniel.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t,” said Emily, sniffing hard. “The
tray’s outside in the hall. She never unlocked her
door.”</p>

<p>“I wish it would choke her!” said Mrs. Carter,
shaken with wrath. Then she drew back from
her son’s arm, wiping her eyes. “Oh, Dan, what’s
the good of your being a lawyer if you can’t get
that boy right out?”</p>

<p>Daniel sighed.</p>

<p>“Give us a little time, mother,” he said gently.
“You take her up to bed, Emily. She’s worn out,
and she’ll only be ill.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I am ill!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter was desperate; she had eaten nothing,
and her head ached from weeping. “I don’t
care for anything but my boy—my Leigh! To
think of it—while I was making him a cherry pie,
too!” she climaxed with more tears.</p>

<p>Emily caught hold of her, sobbing, too. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
eaten most of the pie, and it touched her to the
quick to think of Leigh, pieless and in jail.</p>

<p>“Oh, mama, come up-stairs; it’s going on eleven
o’clock!”</p>

<p>Between them, Daniel and Emily got the weeping
woman up-stairs. Daniel closed the door on
the scene as Emily made her sit down on the side
of the bed and snuff lavender salts.</p>

<p>“Your nose is awfully red, mama,” she said
feelingly. “It’ll make your head ache worse.
Mine aches dreadfully!”</p>

<p>Daniel went softly down to the library, aware of
William’s ceaseless march on the back porch. He
found his father sitting quietly in the oldest cane-bottom
chair, his stockinged feet thrust out in
front of him and his hands in his pockets. He
had never known his father to sit upright in a
hard chair before.</p>

<p>Daniel went wearily over to his mother’s rocker
and sank into it, passing his hand over his eyes.
He rather dreaded a long talk, now that the tension
had snapped; but his father was not inclined
to talk, and only asked a question.</p>

<p>“Think they’ll take bail to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure. Judge Jessup thinks not. Corwin
was unarmed and half tipsy. I’ve got to make
the coroner see Leigh’s part of it. Leigh has just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
told me. He didn’t mean to shoot; he meant to
make the man retract his slander of Fanchon.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made an inarticulate sound under
his breath, and Daniel went on.</p>

<p>“Then it seems that Corwin treated him like a
kid—laughed at him, naturally enough. It wouldn’t
have happened if it hadn’t been that the brute was
drunk and slapped Leigh’s face. Then the boy
snatched out his pistol and fired. He was amazed
when he found he had killed the man—that’s all.
It’s plain enough. Manslaughter in the second
degree, it ought to be, but I’ve got to prove it.
You can’t tell which way the coroner’s jury will
go. It depends on the witnesses to Corwin’s state
and—and character.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter wagged his head slowly and thoughtfully;
his face was haggard and his eyes dim.
There was a painful pause, and the clock chimed
eleven.</p>

<p>“Mama’s all broken up,” he remarked at last,
rising. “I reckon I’d better go up and quiet her.”
He moved slowly toward the door, carrying his
boots. At the door he paused and looked back.
“I haven’t said anything to William,” he remarked
grimly; “not a word; but I reckon he’ll
have it out now with that—that little hussy up-stairs!”</p>

<p>Daniel made no reply to this, and Mr. Carter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
padded softly away. Presently a door shut heavily,
and then Daniel heard Emily going to her
room. She was crying audibly. It seemed to the
listener that she sobbed loudest just outside Fanchon’s
door.</p>

<p>Daniel sat quite still. A great weariness had
come over him. He had eaten nothing since breakfast,
and the fast and the nervous strain had told.
He sank back in his chair and almost ceased thinking,
his eyes closed.</p>

<p>He was falling asleep from sheer exhaustion
when he was startled by a new arrival. The door
from the kitchen opened, and Miranda appeared,
bearing a tray laden with viands and a smoking
cup of tea. She set it down on the corner of the
table.</p>

<p>“Yo’ ain’t had noffin’, Mist’ Dan,” she said
tearfully. “I knows! Plato, he been down heah
to ask fo’ you-all, an’ he tole me yo’ left without
yo’ dinner.”</p>

<p>Daniel looked up into the sympathetic dark face
and smiled.</p>

<p>“You’re very kind, Miranda. I am hungry; I
believe that’s why I nearly fell asleep.”</p>

<p>“Yessuh, I allus eats when I feels bad. Ain’t
noffin’ like it, Mist’ Dan. When my pa died I ate
piece ob bacon an’ two cabbages, I sho’ did. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
reckon dat’s all dat kep’ me from dyin’ of grief.
I sho’ did feel po’erful bad!”</p>

<p>Daniel drew up a chair.</p>

<p>“I’ll take your prescription, Miranda,” he said
gratefully.</p>

<p>Miranda beamed tearfully.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Mist’ Dan! Dere ain’t any cabbage
dere, but dere’s sparrowgrass—an’ dat’s
mos’ as good!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> was up the next morning at six o’clock
and had breakfasted before the other members of
the distracted family appeared. The only one he
saw was his brother. William had stopped his
weary tramp on the piazza at daybreak, and, coming
into the library, had thrown himself on the
lounge. He lay there when Daniel came down,
sleeping the heavy sleep of physical exhaustion.
One arm trailed limply toward the floor, the other
was thrown across his haggard face, hiding it
from view.</p>

<p>Daniel stopped a moment and stood looking at
him, touched with pity. He remembered him as
he had brought his bride up from the station-gates
that first night, so confident in his happiness. It
seemed so long ago! The brothers had been very
sympathetic as boys, though Daniel’s accident and
his subsequent illness, delaying his college course
and putting everything out of joint, had rather
separated them.</p>

<p>He felt drawn toward the sufferer now. If
William had sinned against the finer ethics of society,
if he had slighted a noble girl to marry a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
showy flirt, he was paying the price; and Daniel
felt it. He turned away from the stricken figure
on the lounge with a poignant feeling of commiseration.
Things like this could never be forgotten.
No patching-up would hide the scar in
William’s heart, or make him regard his wife in
the same light again.</p>

<p>Daniel did not rouse him. He went out silently,
bent on doing his utmost for Leigh. Leigh was
Fanchon’s victim as surely as William had been.</p>

<p>And Corwin? Daniel, who had scarcely seen
the man until he saw him lying dead at the coroner’s,
wondered in what measure Fanchon was
responsible for his death, too. There were women
like that, he reflected, and there were others like—Virginia!</p>

<p>The very thought of her brought him a feeling
of happiness, of reassurance. The world could not
be such a bad place, after all, when there were
women like Virginia in it. Even in the darkness
of his present perplexity, Daniel smiled tenderly.
No matter what else happened, Virginia would
not fail him. He felt the touch of her hand on his
and heard her voice again, her sympathy for
Leigh. And she had said nothing against Fanchon.
Not by a word or a glance had she accused
Fanchon.</p>

<p>But he heard it elsewhere. Judge Jessup could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
not control himself, and Mr. Payson, coming into
Jessup’s office to express sympathy for Leigh and
the Carters, did not restrain himself at all. He
thought that William should have made his wife
behave before this. This, in his opinion, was the
natural sequence to that shocking fandango at
the church musicale.</p>

<p>Daniel, meanwhile, labored for Leigh. In spite
of his best efforts, his brother was held for the
grand jury without bail. The fact that Leigh had
gone to Corwin’s room, carrying a pistol with
him, and had there shot an unarmed man, went
against him, despite his youth and his family
connections. Daniel had only a few moments’ talk
with him before he was removed to the county jail.</p>

<p>Judge Jessup, coming out from the inquest, and
mopping his head, used strong language.</p>

<p>“Can’t be for anything but manslaughter, anyway,”
he growled fiercely.</p>

<p>Seeing Mr. Carter sitting in a crumpled heap in
the corner of his office, the judge got a flat, black
bottle from under his desk, poured something into
a glass, and made Johnson Carter swallow it.</p>

<p>“That’ll get you on your feet, Johnson,” he said
gruffly. “We give it to racehorses down in Kentucky.
You can call it arnica, if you’re afraid
of taking to drink.”</p>

<p>Then, while Mr. Carter tried to rally his scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
forces, he moved over to Daniel, who was
standing by the window observing the motor that
was carrying Leigh down to the jail.</p>

<p>“Dan,” said he, lowering his deep bass,
“where’s that woman?”</p>

<p>Daniel started.</p>

<p>“Up at the house, I reckon,” he said. “She was
locked in her room this morning.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to get her story out of her?”
asked the judge. “William?”</p>

<p>Daniel stared out of the window in silence.</p>

<p>“That indictment has got to be either murder
or manslaughter. It depends on the story. Who’s
going to get it? I reckon William can.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” said Daniel quietly. “I’m going up
home now. Can you”—he hesitated—“can you
keep father here?”</p>

<p>The judge nodded. They both glanced at the
man sitting in the judge’s big swivel chair. Mr.
Carter was leaning back dejectedly, with both
hands clenched on the arms of the chair, and his
head bent forward. He was staring fixedly at the
blotting-paper on the judge’s desk, his mouth
hanging open. Daniel picked up his hat and quietly
left the room.</p>

<p>He did not walk home. He was worn out and
he hailed a taxi. He had already telephoned the
verdict of the coroner’s jury to his mother, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
he knew they were, in a measure, prepared for the
worst; but his heart sank as he ascended the familiar
old steps. Even the rose-bush beside the door
seemed to bewail the thought of the youngest boy,
the mother’s pet, being in jail.</p>

<p>Emily opened the door for him. Her nose was
still red, and she was trying vainly to wink back
her tears.</p>

<p>“Mama’s gone to bed,” she announced chokingly.
“She’s cried herself sick. And William’s
gone out—I don’t know where he’s gone. Mama’s
afraid he’ll—he’ll drown himself!”</p>

<p>“He came down to Judge Jessup’s office to hear
about Leigh, and he’s gone over to the Payson
Building,” said Daniel dryly. “You go and tell
mother he’s all right. And—listen, Emily—I’ve
got to see Fanchon. Will you please ask her to
come down-stairs?”</p>

<p>“Ask Fanchon to come down-stairs? Me?”
Emily crumpled. “I guess I won’t!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to see her,” repeated Daniel. He
drew a pad from his pocket, wrote a line on it,
and folded it. “You take that up, Emmy.”</p>

<p>Emily backed.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to save Leigh?” asked Daniel
sharply. “Yes? Then you take that up and stick
it under her door and knock. She’ll read it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“She won’t. She hasn’t eaten anything. I
think she’s going to starve herself to death.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You do as I say.”</p>

<p>Emily still backed. Then, catching his eye, she
wavered, took the paper, and ran, sobbing, up-stairs.</p>

<p>Daniel waited impatiently, walking up and down
the hall. He had never been able to form a clear
idea of Fanchon. He could not even conjecture
what she would do. He had never believed in her,
he did not believe in her now, and he felt the
deepest resentment toward her for having brought
his young brother to this.</p>

<p>He was still walking up and down the hall when
Emily called to him from the staircase in a watery
stage whisper:</p>

<p>“She says, come up to her room.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly Daniel went up-stairs. Emily was
hanging over the banisters at the top.</p>

<p>“She’s in the little front room over the door,”
she whispered, sniffing. “I think she’s going
away; I saw her trunks open.”</p>

<p>Daniel nodded and made his way to the small
room over the front door, which his mother had
hastily converted into a boudoir for the bride.
He remembered the night when Leigh had helped
her put a fresh polish on the floor before they laid
the new rug. These little things seemed to crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
into his mind, bringing back Leigh’s boyish face
in the dim cell, his terror of the dead Corwin.</p>

<p>He knocked gently at the closed door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Fanchon’s voice.</p>

<p>Daniel entered and stood still.</p>

<p>The little room, finished in pink and white, was
in wild disorder. A small hat-box trunk stood
open, a traveling-bag gaped, half-packed, and innumerable
articles, large and small, were scattered
on the chairs and on the floor. Stretched on
a lounge, in front of the window, lay Fanchon.
Her head was on her arms, and her soft hair, falling
loose over her shoulders, hid her face. She
wore some loose black robe which made her small
figure look even smaller and more childish than
usual. There was something in her very attitude
broken and forlorn, and Daniel felt his first touch
of actual pity for her as she rose on her elbow
and lifted her haggard face from her arm. Her
eyes were hollow, and even her lips were white.
No touch of rouge concealed the havoc of a sleepless
night and a day of anguish.</p>

<p>Her expression so amazed Daniel that he stood
still, just inside the door, looking at her. Fanchon
straightened up, dropping her feet to the floor,
and holding herself erect in her place by gripping
the edge of the lounge with nervous, shaking
fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Is—is Leigh in jail?” she asked faintly, her
dark eyes fixed on Daniel’s face.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Held for the grand jury. Haven’t they told
you?”</p>

<p>“No one tells me anything; no one speaks to
me! I’m going away; I’m packing up. But
Leigh? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> I’m human, I want to know
about Leigh!”</p>

<p>“I came here to ask you to help me save Leigh,”
said Daniel quietly. “It’s got to be either murder
or manslaughter. It depends on you, Fanchon.”</p>

<p>“On me?” She drew a long breath, her eyes
darkening with emotion. “<i>Que voulez vous?</i> What
can I do?”</p>

<p>“Tell us the whole story, Fanchon. Tell us
about Corwin. I’ve no doubt at all that he deserved
to be shot—but not by Leigh.”</p>

<p>Fanchon drew in her breath, setting her small,
white teeth hard on her under lip. She did not look
toward Daniel, but away into a corner of the room,
as if she saw things unseen and terrible. A deep
blush mounted suddenly and painfully to her forehead.
Daniel waited patiently, leaning against the
door. At last she turned and raised her eyes pitifully
to his.</p>

<p>“Why must I tell?” she asked brokenly, twisting
her handkerchief about with feverish fingers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
tears coming suddenly and running down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Leigh shot an unarmed man in his own room,”
replied Daniel dryly. “We’ve got to show cause
why the man should have been shot. Corwin has
blackened you—yes, but that was William’s business,
and there’s nothing—forgive me, Fanchon,
but there’s nothing to show that Corwin didn’t
speak the truth, except what you yourself can tell
us.”</p>

<p>“William believes what he said, then!” she
cried hoarsely. “That’s why he hasn’t spoken to
me or looked at me since—since Corwin was shot!
He believes it—you all believe it!”</p>

<p>Daniel’s face hardened. He saw a storm coming
and he despised the way she ranted.</p>

<p>“I’m asking you to tell us the truth.”</p>

<p>She half rose, panting.</p>

<p>“You ask it because—because you believe what
he said!”</p>

<p>“I ask it—to save Leigh.”</p>

<p>She sank back, weak and shaken. Then she
dashed the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything for Leigh! He’s the only one
who believed in me.”</p>

<p>“He believed in you enough to put his life in
jeopardy,” Daniel replied grimly. “If you want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to help him, you’ll have to tell me the whole story,
Fanchon.”</p>

<p>She worked at her handkerchief again, winking
back her tears, and he had a chance to see how
her face had hollowed and how weak she looked.
He remembered that Emily had said she had refused
food, and it occurred to him that they were
cruel to her; that she resented their cruelty. But,
all the while, he saw that boyish face in the dingy
light of the cell, and his heart grew hot within him.
He wouldn’t spare her.</p>

<p>“You want to know about Corwin?”</p>

<p>Her voice was very low. Daniel assented, and
she seemed to struggle with herself.</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu!</i>” she cried softly.</p>

<p>“As soon as you can, please,” said Daniel,
watching her, wondering if now, under this stress
and pain, she would tell the truth. He doubted it.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what I told you in the library
that day?” she asked abruptly. “About
my father and my mother and the convent?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was a lie,” said Fanchon. “It was the same
lie that I told William.”</p>

<p>Daniel looked at her grimly, unsparingly.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re going to tell me the truth now,”
he said sternly.</p>

<p>She dragged some soft pillows toward her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
leaned her elbows on them, half hiding her face
in her hands, not looking at him at all.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” she said in a low voice. “I’ll tell
you the whole story from the beginning. It was
true that my father was French, and that he was
a vine-grower and wine-maker on a ranch in California,
and that my mother, the Irish girl, died
there. My father did take me to Paris, but he
didn’t put me in a convent school. He left me
with his sister, a milliner in one of the little back
streets. They were alike, those two, of an ugliness
inside and out. For a while he paid for me,
and then he didn’t. I think he drank himself to
death. My aunt brought me up. She wasn’t a
good woman and she was greedy for money. I
was pretty, and she had me taught to dance and
sing. I was dancing when Aristide Corwin saw
me. He was managing a vaudeville company in
London then. He took a fancy to me.”</p>

<p>Fanchon stopped a moment, pressing her handkerchief
against her lips. Then she went on,
speaking rapidly and recklessly.</p>

<p>“You think it was the old story? <i>Mais non</i>, it
wasn’t! I was only fifteen and I hated him. I
hated his good looks and his showy dress and his
coarse voice—but I was a beggar and I was a child,
<i>enfant de Bohème</i>. My aunt told him he could
have me for a price. He must marry me—marry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
in Paris, too. You know French law? And he
was to pay her—about three thousand dollars in
your money. She sold me. I was her niece, and
she made him marry me. She made me his slave
good and fast, for she made me his wife!”</p>

<p>“You mean that you were Corwin’s wife, and
you never told my brother?” Daniel exclaimed
harshly, leaning forward to look at her.</p>

<p>She turned, her white, small face shadowed by
her wild hair, her eyes smoldering.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell your brother? <i>Non!</i> I didn’t tell.
Now, listen—I’ll tell you all, and you can tell
your brother,” she added bitterly. “I was fifteen,
and I was small for my years. Corwin trained
me. He saw what I could do, and he trained
me like a spaniel. For what? To support him,
<i>mon ami</i>! I danced and I sang for four years to
support a man who never worked. He lived on
me. Sometimes I was ill, sometimes I was broken
with grief and shame, but it made no difference—he
lived on what I made. I was worth more
than the money he had paid—a hundred times
over! When he was drunk he beat me. I’ve
had black welts on my shoulders that I had to
hide when I danced. I was sixteen then, and
afraid, deadly afraid of him. I was even afraid
to run away. Then I grew older, and I tried to
get a divorce in Paris, but I couldn’t. I tried in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
London, and failed again. He saw to that. Then
I knew I must wait. I was American; I was born
here. I waited. By and by Aristide brought me
to New York and put me in a company to tour
the Western States. That was luck—great luck—for
he was ill. He was strong as an ox, but
he had appendicitis, and had to go to a hospital
in New York. I went to California. I was just
twenty-one. I told William I was eighteen, but
I’m twenty-four. In California I got a divorce
for cruelty. I got my freedom. From a child
I had been in the hands of a brute; suddenly I
was free!” She looked up again, pressing her
hands against her breast. “<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I can’t tell
you what I felt!”</p>

<p>She ceased speaking and sank down again on
her elbows. This time she tore at the cushions
with her restless fingers.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Daniel ruthlessly. “This doesn’t
bring us to Leigh.”</p>

<p>She looked around at him, her face twisting
oddly to keep back her tears.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. I was divorced—it was legal
in California, though Aristide swore it wasn’t.
He came at me like a wild beast. He tried to
get the decree set aside. He threatened; he swore
vengeance. Then I told him that I’d die before
I went back to him. I meant it, and he knew it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
I remember when we were first married, and I
was only fifteen, I used to go about looking for
places to throw myself into the Seine; but I never
could, it was so dirty!” She shuddered. “He
vowed he’d never let me go, and he never has.
He followed me about and published false stories
about me. Once he got me arrested for theft. I
was innocent. He couldn’t prove it, and they let
me go. He tried and tried to get me back, to
take away my work and starve me into coming
back. Then, when he saw that I wouldn’t come
back, he was terrible. I married William. No,
not in Paris! We were married in New York
when the ship docked. You didn’t know that,
<i>n’est-ce-pas</i>? But what would you? I couldn’t be
married in Paris. I couldn’t tell my story; I
wouldn’t tell it.” She raised tortured eyes to
Daniel’s face. “I loved William; I couldn’t risk
it. We were married, and Corwin heard of it. He
wrote me a letter then. He said he’d ruin me;
he’d see to it that my husband got a divorce; he’d
fix me—and he’s done it!”</p>

<p>“Have you got that letter?” Daniel asked quickly,
a flash in his dark eyes. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give it to you,” she said brokenly. “It’s
all true, Dan, this time—all true! You can have
his letter. That night—the ride—your father
thinks I disgraced you all. I went alone. Corwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
rode after me, and I did go back with him.
I ate dinner with him. I begged him not to ruin
me; not to publish lies about me. I begged and
begged. I had no money. He had always taken
every cent I earned, and the little I got after the
divorce I’d paid out for clothes—all but a trifle.
I offered that, and he laughed at me. He boasted
that he had me; that no other man would keep
me. He said I’d be turned out of a respectable
family when he got done with me—and then I
would come back to him.” She turned with a
pitiful gesture. “I could do nothing to stop his
mouth. Who would speak for me? Whoever
speaks for a woman when a man like that blackmails
her? You—you all hated me!”</p>

<p>Daniel, who had risen, stood looking at her,
his face brooding.</p>

<p>“On my soul, Fanchon, I pity you!” he said
simply. “But why—why, in Heaven’s name,
didn’t you tell William the truth?”</p>

<p>She shivered, cowering away from him.</p>

<p>“I—I’ve always been a liar,” she replied with
white lips. “I was brought up to lie. And”—she
rose and faced him—“I couldn’t give him up.
He was good, he loved me—<i>mon Dieu</i>!” She covered
her face with her shaking hands. “And I’ve
ruined his brother, the boy who liked me so well!”</p>

<p>Daniel pitied her, pitied her profoundly. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
story had appealed to the lawyer in him, he had
been watching and listening for some word that
he could use to save Leigh; but now something in
her cry of pain, in her small, black-clad figure,
her wildly lovely face, touched him.</p>

<p>“Fanchon,” he said gently, “please give me
that letter.”</p>

<p>She lifted her head. Her tear-stained eyes met
his, searched his, read a touch of friendliness in
them, and her lips shook.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” she said.</p>

<p>She took a step forward, she seemed about to
go into her bedroom, but suddenly she swayed,
her head fell forward, and she stretched out both
her hands helplessly, gropingly.</p>

<p>“It’s all black!” she gasped. “I can’t see!”</p>

<p>Daniel caught her barely in time, for she had
fainted in his arms.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanchon</span> was very ill that night. Her stormy
nature had plunged into an eclipse, and she lay
white and shivering, staring at the ceiling, her
half-packed trunks around her. She would not
let even Emily come near her—only Miranda and
the doctor, whom Daniel had summoned hastily.
She had not tasted food since Leigh’s shot, and
she was worn out.</p>

<p>Dr. Barbour, prescribing food and quiet, made
some gruff remarks to Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>“No use killing her,” he said dryly. “Might
as well keep her alive, as long as Corwin’s dead.”</p>

<p>William did not come home at all, but spent the
night in his office. Daniel went down there on
his way to court in the morning. The elevator-boy,
a young mulatto, showed the whites of his
eyes as he took him up.</p>

<p>“He ain’t been down fo’ noffin’ to eat,” he remarked.
“Sen’ me fo’ bottle of whisky, but ain’t
eat noffin’.”</p>

<p>Daniel frowned. He had had his suspicions of
the whisky before, though his father had never
told him of his own surmises. He limped quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
over to William’s door, found it unlocked, and
walked in.</p>

<p>The shades were still drawn and the electric
lights switched on. William lay stretched on an
old couch in the corner, his arms under his head.
At first Daniel thought he was drunk, but as their
eyes met he saw that William was terribly sober.
He had a look in his eyes that gave his brother
a shock. It was the look of a man who coveted
death.</p>

<p>The couch was one of those high-backed affairs
with a low arm at each end. Daniel sat down
on the arm at William’s feet.</p>

<p>“Fanchon’s ill,” he said quietly. “You’d better
go home and see her, William.”</p>

<p>William looked at him intently for a moment,
then spoke in a voice so changed that it was
startling.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see her,” he said coolly. “I
don’t care if I never see her again.”</p>

<p>“She’s your wife, all the same,” Daniel remarked
dryly, “and she’s going to help me save
Leigh.”</p>

<p>“I’m done with her,” William retorted.</p>

<p>“You can’t say that—you won’t say it—if she
sacrifices herself for us,” returned Daniel, watching
him.</p>

<p>“I’m done with her,” William repeated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
closed his eyes, evidently considering that he had
closed the subject.</p>

<p>Daniel observed him a moment in silence. He
was perfectly aware that argument was useless,
and he was not altogether prepared to argue for
Fanchon. His brother—who looked ill and
wretched—was apparently falling asleep, so Daniel
went to the table, confiscated a half-empty bottle
of whisky, and switched off the lights. He
drew up the shades and opened all the windows,
and the dead atmosphere of the room was revivified
with sunshine and air.</p>

<p>Daniel looked at William again, but there was
no movement or sound from him, so the lame
brother left the room, closing the door softly behind
him. He had a strange feeling as if he had
closed it upon a corpse, as if the brother he had
known had passed away, and into this shell that
was left behind some other spirit had entered.
The thought reminded Daniel of the seven devils
of the Bible. Certainly the change in William
was for the worse.</p>

<p>But he had no time to think of William. His
business took him to Judge Jessup’s office, and
from there to the court-house, where a panel of
the grand jury had been summoned. As he made
his way toward Jessup’s office he encountered a
crowd on the main street, and saw a hearse proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
toward the station, carrying a plain pinewood
box. The inquest being over, Corwin’s body
was to be shipped to New York.</p>

<p>Daniel had to wait for the hearse to pass, aware
of the curious glances that came his way. A picture
rose before his mind of a little girl of fifteen
being married to a coarse brute more than twice
her age, who wanted her to earn his living for
him. If he could only get that picture clean-cut
before a jury!</p>

<p>Daniel had that delicate keenness of perception
that makes great orators feel their audiences.
He knew intuitively the thing that touched the
heart, he had latent in him a gift for playing on
the feelings of the masses, as some musicians
have in them a singular power to draw more music
from the chords of their instruments than
other men. He had perceived it, too, in Fanchon,
if he could only mold her to her rôle. He was
trying to marshal his thoughts, to see a way to
bring Fanchon before the jury without losing
the effect of her evidence, when he reached Jessup’s
office.</p>

<p>The judge, who was waiting to go before the
grand jury, was sitting in his swivel chair in his
shirt-sleeves, with his hat on. He scarcely glanced
up when Daniel entered, for he was listening to
a visitor. Samuel Bernstein sat in the prisoner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
dock—as Daniel called the stiff chair by the window
where the judge seated his doubtful clients
and penalized them with a savage, unwavering
observation. He was observing Bernstein now
over the tops of his glasses, exactly as he would
have observed a gipsy-moth. To his mind, Bernstein
had been nearly as disastrous.</p>

<p>The motion-picture producer seemed to be suffering
extremely from the heat. He had his hat
off, and was mopping beads of perspiration from
his forehead.</p>

<p>“Say, judge, I never thought about a kid like
that usin’ shootin’-irons,” he said mournfully.
“But I told him the truth—every bit of it! I’ll
go on the stand an’ swear to it. You see, it was
this way—I couldn’t get the thing to ’em, an’ I
thought they oughter know.”</p>

<p>The judge glared at him in silence, then swung
his swivel chair around a little and looked over
the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>“Meddling, Mr. Bernstein; nothing at all but
meddling in other people’s business,” he retorted
shortly. “If I had my way there’d be a new law
in this State. I’d send nosey people to the work-house,
sir. I’d give ’em something to do. Here’s
your deposition. Read it over. You’ll be called
again, some time this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Now, looka here, judge, I ain’t a meddler,” objected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Bernstein plaintively. “That man Corwin
was blackmailin’ the lady and I wanted to stop
him. I’m conferring a favor now, sir, goin’ on
the stand. Anybody who knows Sam Bernstein
knows he ain’t goin’ to lie. I’ve got a reputation.
This trial, sir, with me on the stand——” He
paused regretfully. “Say, it would make just
about three thousand feet of great stuff—and they
won’t let me bring in my camera-men!”</p>

<p>“Confound your camera-men!” said the judge,
and rose, slamming down the top of his desk.
“Dan, you here? We’ve got to go over to the
court-house now. You come over in half an hour,
Bernstein. I reckon it isn’t more than one thousand
feet of film to the square,” he added with
a sudden, irresistible twinkle.</p>

<p>Even Bernstein laughed.</p>

<p>The judge, linking his arm in Daniel’s, kept
pace with the younger man as they walked up the
main street toward the old court-house. It was a
little past ten o’clock now, and the street was full.
Daniel noticed that the tide was flowing toward
the court-house. His cheeks reddened angrily
under the curious glances of men and women in
the crowds.</p>

<p>There had been a strong element of sympathy
for Corwin. He had been freehanded, and had
made himself at home in local sporting circles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
Daniel, with his fine perception of the trend of
human feeling, knew that the sympathy was not
all on their side. Fanchon’s famous dance at the
church musicale, and her frequent appearances
with the man himself, had all worked against her.
It did not seem quite fair to lay all the blame on
Corwin.</p>

<p>If William had shot him, the thing would have
been understood. Leigh’s act was subject to terrible
misinterpretations. It seemed as if the
Carter family had employed a boy to do the shooting
in the hope of getting off scot-free. To half
the men on the street it looked like a case of sheer
cowardice on the husband’s part, and Daniel knew
it. He had that kind of sensitiveness—wrought
up by much solitary suffering and introspective
thought—that made this consciousness of the possible
charge of cowardice against them all a kind
of torture. He was very white, and his eyes
sparkled dangerously.</p>

<p>“He looks as if he might kill a man, lame as
he is,” one of the bystanders whispered, and
Daniel heard it.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we can get an indictment
for manslaughter, Dan,” said the judge, in his
ear. “Seems to me it’ll be murder, but there’s no
telling with that jury.”</p>

<p>Daniel, thinking of Leigh’s boyish face and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
girlish eyes, set his teeth very hard. At that moment
he had no feeling of pity for Fanchon.</p>

<p>“When a man gets married the way William
did,” remarked the judge, “it’s mighty like putting
your hand into a grab-bag at a church fair.
You’re not going to get anything useful out of it.”</p>

<p>Daniel said nothing.</p>

<p>They crossed the square and ascended the court-house
steps half an hour before the time set for
the grand jury.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Carter came down to Judge Jessup’s
office and collapsed there. He had intended
to go on to the court-house, but he could not. He
sat down limply in the judge’s chair with one hand
on the telephone, waiting to be called.</p>

<p>He had passed a terrible night. Mrs. Carter
had indulged in the only fit of hysterics she had
ever had in her life, and her husband had thought,
at first, that it was apoplexy. He had summoned
Dr. Barbour, rousing the good man from his bed,
and had caught a lecture for it.</p>

<p>“Never seen a woman in hysterics before?” the
doctor asked fiercely. “Put her feet in hot mustard
water. I reckon that when you see a real
fit you’ll turn in the fire-alarm!”</p>

<p>But he was unable to eradicate Mr. Carter’s
first impressions. Thinking it over now, he shook
his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Never saw her like that in her life before,” he
reflected. “Had seven children and lost three—and
never threw a fit before! If Leigh——”</p>

<p>He stopped at that; he couldn’t go any further.
He rose and pulled off his coat and unbuttoned
his collar. He felt that the heat—it was only an
ordinary summer day—was intolerably oppressive.
Then he took down the telephone receiver
absently, and had to assure central that he didn’t
want anything.</p>

<p>“Knocked it off by accident,” he explained mendaciously.</p>

<p>But the incident embarrassed him, and he collapsed
into the chair again and fanned himself
with his hat. Then the telephone-bell rang sharply
in his ear, and he seized the receiver. A tremulous
young voice called:</p>

<p>“Is Judge Jessup there?”</p>

<p>“No, the judge has gone over to the court-house.
This is Mr. Carter—Johnson Carter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” It was Emily, and he could almost
feel her tears through the instrument. “Mama
thought you might be at the judge’s office. Got
any news about Leigh?”</p>

<p>“Not yet!” Mr. Carter was hoarse, but he
cleared his throat. “How’s mama?”</p>

<p>“She’s all right; she’s just taken peppermint
tea. Papa, I’ve got something to tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Her voice seemed to die away, but he heard her
blowing her nose.</p>

<p>“What is it, Emmy?”</p>

<p>“F-Fanchon’s going—she’s got the expressman
here for her trunks.”</p>

<p>“Glad of it!” said Mr. Carter dryly. “If she
wants a taxi, I’ll send it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Mama says she’ll die if she doesn’t know
about Leigh soon!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, I—say, I see the judge and
Dan coming—I’ll call you up again in a minute!”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and rushed to the door.
Judge Jessup and his son came in soberly. The
judge threw his hat down on the table and said
nothing.</p>

<p>“Indicted for murder—second degree, father,”
said Daniel, averting his eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter tottered to a chair and covered his
face with his hands. In the silence of the little
office they heard the first shrill cry of a newsboy.</p>

<p>“Extry! Extry! Leigh Carter indicted for
murder! Extry!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter groaned aloud. Then he remembered.</p>

<p>“Dan, Emmy ’phoned me a few minutes ago.
That—that woman’s leaving the house—bag and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
baggage. If you want to ask her anything——”</p>

<p>Judge Jessup interrupted with a roar.</p>

<p>“Get a taxi, Dan! Catch her, don’t let her go!
I’ll subpœna her, if necessary. Stop her!”</p>

<p>Daniel, who had turned a startled face on his
father, nodded at the judge.</p>

<p>“’Phone mother, father,” he said quietly. “It
isn’t fair to keep her waiting even ten minutes.
I’ll go out there at once.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he whistled for a passing taxi. He
heard his father’s shaking voice at the phone as
he went out.</p>

<p>The cab went off at top speed, and Daniel sank
back in the corner, resting his head against the
stiff old cushion. He felt a great weariness, a sensation
of defeat and despair. He had fought hard
for an indictment for manslaughter, but had succeeded
in getting a second degree of murder only
by the most strenuous effort and the appeal of
Leigh’s obvious youth. Daniel knew that they had
a hard fight before them, and he doubted the
boy’s nerve. The whole thing was hideous to him.</p>

<p>He looked out with dull eyes, aware of the swift
passing of the street corners. The taxi swung
into the church lane with a shriek of its warning
horn, and Daniel looked around at the church
door, thinking of Virginia.</p>

<p>The next moment he saw her. The old wagonette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
and the two fat horses appeared, progressing
slowly toward town. Colonel Denbigh and his
granddaughter were sitting in the vehicle, facing
each other on the two long seats.</p>

<p>Virginia saw Daniel and waved to him. He
knew that they had the news, for the colonel was
reading an extra, and Virginia’s face was full of
it. She seemed to fling him a message of sympathy
and courage and faith. Daniel felt it. It roused
him. He felt suddenly the impulse of the fighter,
and he shut his teeth on it. He must win, he
would win!</p>

<p>He was still feeling it when the taxi stopped
abruptly at the Carter gate and the chauffeur
got down to collect his fare. Daniel paid it absently,
aware that the man was staring at the
figure that he saw on the piazza.</p>

<p>In the midst of a pile of luggage stood Fanchon.
She was dressed for the street, and wore a hat and
a fashionable veil that made a singular figure on
the side of her pale cheek, like the tail of a black
dragon. She was leaning against a trunk that
stood on end, her dark eyes fixed gloomily on her
approaching brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“What’s this, Fanchon?” he asked quickly.
“You’re not going to fail me?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stay here! You can tell William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
that he can come home. I’m going over to a
boarding house on the turnpike. I found it
once——”</p>

<p>She blushed suddenly and pitifully, and Daniel
knew she referred to her ride. He drew a breath
of relief.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he began, half ashamed that she
felt driven from the house, and painfully remembering
William.</p>

<p>She caught his sleeve, her hand shaking.</p>

<p>“Daniel, tell me—the indictment?”</p>

<p>“Murder in the second degree.”</p>

<p>She reeled back, clutching at the trunk, her face
deathly and her fawn-like eyes fixed on his.</p>

<p>“What—what’s the penalty?”</p>

<p>“In this State, imprisonment—five to eighteen
years.”</p>

<p>“Five to eighteen years—in prison—for—for
Leigh!” she repeated slowly, gasping.</p>

<p>She sank down, leaning on the trunk, and trembling,
her eyes still fixed on Daniel’s white, set,
unpitying face.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she cried at last, and burst into
passionate tears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Denbigh</span> was reading the morning
paper. He had breakfasted lightly, and he sat on
the rear veranda smoking a long cigar. His face
was troubled. He had a sincere friendship for
the Carters, and he fairly twinged as he read the
flaring headlines. There were three columns devoted
to the Corwin murder, with a snap-shot of
Leigh being led from the court-house to the police
van. Half-way down the first column there was
an extra large caption to one paragraph:</p>

<p class="center">MRS. WILLIAM CARTER, THE CAUSE OF<br>
THE TROUBLE, ONCE A BEAUTIFUL<br>
VAUDEVILLE DANCER</p>

<p>The colonel slapped his paper down on his knee
with a groan.</p>

<p>“By gum!” he ejaculated softly.</p>

<p>Plato thrust his head out of the door.</p>

<p>“Miss Jinny done say she don’ want dat
speckled hen killed fo’ dinner to-morrer, suh.”</p>

<p>The colonel’s mouth twisted under his white
mustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Miss Jinny, she’s been makin’ a pet ob her,
yessuh. She say dat speckled hen ain’t gwine ter
be killed, an’ I kin take de rooster. Miss Jinny,
she say she’s fo’ woman’s rights, col’nel.”</p>

<p>The colonel grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>“You get a steak, Plato. We’ve got to stand
up for our own sex. I’m going to keep that rooster.”</p>

<p>“Yessuh, dat we has!” Plato edged back toward
the door as he heard Virginia coming. “Mis’
Wilyum Carter done run away from her husband
yes’day,” he added in a stage whisper. “Mirandy,
de girl dat works dere, done tole me so,
yessuh!”</p>

<p>The colonel scowled.</p>

<p>“You tell Miranda to stop gossiping,” he said
sharply.</p>

<p>Plato grinned.</p>

<p>“Dat’s woman’s rights, yessuh. Mirandy says
so!”</p>

<p>The colonel caught the old negro’s eye and
shook with silent laughter.</p>

<p>“Mind your own business, you old rogue!” he
said shortly, resuming his paper.</p>

<p>He heard Plato’s discreet retirement and then
a frou-frou of skirts. Virginia, in the freshest
of white gowns, came out. She was very pale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
and there was a little line of worry between her
brows.</p>

<p>“Anything new, grandpa?” she asked eagerly,
looking at his newspaper. “Can they get Leigh
out on bail?”</p>

<p>The colonel shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Think of a boy like that held for murder!
Bless my soul, it seems as if it was only last year
when I saw him in rompers and eating a lollypop.
I remember perfectly—the stick was in his mouth
and the lollypop all over his face. Good Lord!
And he’s shot a man!”</p>

<p>“He’s such a nice boy,” said Virginia. “He
has such a sweet, dreamy face, and his eyes are
beautiful. Haven’t you noticed how he’s grown
up?”</p>

<p>“Yep!” the colonel snapped, frowning at space.
“I did notice he was getting to be quite a young
lady.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed musically.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” Then
her face sobered. “I’ve just telephoned to Mrs.
Carter—I mean Mrs. Johnson Carter,” she explained,
blushing suddenly; “and there doesn’t
seem to be anything that we can do.”</p>

<p>The colonel nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I saw Dr. Barbour last night. He says there’s
nothing we can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>Virginia looked thoughtfully across the green
lawn toward the street. It was screened from
view here by the colonel’s horse-chestnut, but she
glimpsed a strip of the street below the side gate.
The sunlight, shining through the honeysuckle on
the veranda, flashed on her white gown with glorification,
as if it shouted halleluiah, and it shone,
too, in her clear eyes. The colonel, who was
watching her, thought her the loveliest thing on
earth.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’s a terrible time down there,”
she remarked regretfully. “I mean at the Carters.”</p>

<p>The colonel assented. He was thinking. He
dreaded to tell her.</p>

<p>“Jinny, Plato says that——”</p>

<p>He got no farther; she had uttered a soft exclamation
and gone down the steps.</p>

<p>“There’s Dan, grandpa!” she said in evident
surprise.</p>

<p>The colonel watched her go on to meet Daniel
Carter and he saw the change in the young man’s
face as they met on the lawn. Daniel was very
pale, and he limped badly toward her.</p>

<p>“By gum!” said the colonel below his breath.
“I wonder if she knows! Women don’t like weakness,
I’m afraid. Nothing that’s been injured appeals—not
really. Girls like to imagine demigods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
And that poor boy’s breaking his heart for her, by
gum!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Virginia turned with Daniel, and
they came toward the veranda. The colonel rose
and descended the steps.</p>

<p>“Dan,” he said in a hoarse voice, holding out
his hand, “if there’s anything I can do——”</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head, the muscles of his white
face twitching a little from weariness and pain.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, Colonel, except—to feel for
us!”</p>

<p>“Come and sit with us on the piazza,” suggested
Virginia. “Can’t you, Dan?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go on to the office, and then over—to
the jail. I was passing—I had to stop to say
‘howdy,’ as Plato would express it. Mother’s been
ill in bed since yesterday. She wanted me to
thank you both for the flowers and for your messages.”</p>

<p>“Flowers and messages are mighty poor substitutes
for deeds,” rejoined the colonel bluntly.
“You know I’ll go bail for Leigh, if you wish it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Payson did that at once, thank you. We
had Leigh out to see mother, but we couldn’t keep
reporters away from him, and we thought it best
for him to go back to jail for the present. You
see, he wants to go to Fanchon, to express his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
championship and all that. It’s a hard situation,
colonel, any way we can fix it. Leigh’s been in a
state of collapse, too—lost his nerve at first.”</p>

<p>“He’s nothing but a kid,” said the colonel with
indignation. “I—by gum, Dan, I don’t like to say
what I think!”</p>

<p>Virginia clapped her soft hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>“Not another word, grandpa!”</p>

<p>Daniel smiled.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Virginia, the newspapers are blatant.
My father read the paper this morning and
broke the cream-pitcher—the Wedgewood one,
too.”</p>

<p>The colonel caught Virginia’s restraining hand
and held it.</p>

<p>“Dan, how’s William?”</p>

<p>Daniel, who was looking at Virginia, became
very grave.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to answer that, colonel. He’s
heartbroken over Leigh, I think. He and his wife”—Daniel
hesitated, his eyes on Virginia—“have
separated,” he concluded in a low voice.</p>

<p>The colonel, who knew it, only wagged his head
soberly, but Virginia started. A deep blush rose
from her throat to her white forehead. Her eyes
fell before Daniel’s, and he saw her hands tremble.</p>

<p>“She loves him still!” he thought bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>He turned, looking paler than ever.</p>

<p>“I must go on. I only stopped to thank you
both for your sympathy. We”—he hesitated
again—“we appreciate it.”</p>

<p>The colonel laid his hand on the younger man’s
shoulder, and his eyes misted.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk to the street with you, Dan,” he said,
swallowing a lump in his throat. “I reckon there
isn’t much we can do—any of us—but to stand
by you-all.”</p>

<p>Daniel looked back at Virginia, raising his hat
again, and the two men walked away across the
long lawn to the group of cedars that grew by the
side gate.</p>

<p>Virginia, left alone, turned and entered the
house. She was very pale now, and her lips trembled.
She went into the drawing-room and stood
looking at the little old picture of William as a
boy. She had looked at it a thousand times before,
and she remembered that once she had kissed it.
They had always been fond of each other and then—or
was it a dream?—he had asked her to marry
him. They had planned their happiness gaily,
with youthful laughter at sorrow and doubt. She
had loved him, and he had married—this woman!</p>

<p>Virginia would have been less than human if
she had not thrilled at the thought that he must
regret it. She felt that he did. He had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
almost said so. He had been caught; she knew
it! What woman, placed as Virginia was, would
not have felt that! In the rush of sympathy for
him she blamed only Fanchon.</p>

<p>She remembered the night at the Sunday-school
hall and Fanchon’s blanched face at the sight of
Corwin. Corwin had made Virginia shudder;
but such men as this had been Fanchon’s associates,
such men as Corwin had been part of her life,
and William Carter had unwittingly married her!
In the storm of her resentment, Virginia felt only
that William needed her sympathy, he even needed—it
was on the tip of her tongue to say—her love!</p>

<p>Then the thing suddenly stood out before her;
she saw it in all its horrible nakedness and cruelty.
The poor little wayward dancer caught in the
snare of her past—whatever that past might be—and
in the midst of her fancied security assailed
and ruined, snatched from her new happiness,
talked about, shamed, and at last cast out!</p>

<p>Yet—poor William! Tears rushed to Virginia’s
eyes. Her heart yearned over him. At that moment,
when William was breaking with the wife
that he had preferred to her, when he was crushed
by the scandal that the woman had made of his
life, Virginia forgave him.</p>

<p>She sank down on the piano-stool under his
childish picture, and, covering her face with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
hands, she wept—not for herself, as Fanchon had
done, but for William. She had fought hard to
crush out her love for him, but at that moment
she felt that she had not succeeded, that it was
too strong for her, and she trembled.</p>

<p>She trembled at the thought of the look on his
face when she had seen him last. She knew that
he had come back to her. Virginia, who could
not see into the future, still felt a thrill of terror
at her heart. It was as if an invisible power
walked with her, an invisible hand thrust her toward
unforeseen perils, and into ways that she
knew not.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, too, in the midst of her emotion,
the thought came to her, keenly and vividly—what
would Dan think of it? And of her—Virginia?
In some way, intuitively, for he had said
nothing about it, she knew that Daniel’s attitude
toward Fanchon had changed. Something in the
very intonation of his voice had told her that;
yet he had announced the separation without comment,
and had even appeared to assent to Colonel
Denbigh’s suppressed recognition of Fanchon’s
culpability.</p>

<p>Virginia, weeping for William, trembling at the
thought that William’s heart must have turned
remorsefully to the memories of their innocent affection,
nevertheless flushed at the thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Daniel would be a witness, a bystander, at any
drama that unrolled now in their lives. She had
never thought of Daniel before as having any part
between William and her, but now it was Daniel’s
judgment that mattered. Yet she loved William.
She no longer attempted to deny that to herself,
she could not—it was William who was suffering
and shamed by the woman who had left him.</p>

<p>Virginia was softly wiping the tears from her
eyes when she heard her grandfather coming back.
She rose, looked hastily into the mirror, and, reassured
by the face she saw there, went out into
the hall and met him.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to walk all the way
into town with Dan,” she remarked casually.</p>

<p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

<p>“I only went to the corner. Jinny, the trial’s
to be next week. Judge Jessup has managed to
rush it before the court adjourns this session. It
seems Mrs. Carter can’t bear the suspense, and I
reckon the boy can’t, either. I never did think
Leigh had much grit—not even when he ate lollypops,”
he added grimly, eying Virginia.</p>

<p>“I know his poor mother has gone to pieces,”
she replied gently. “Emily told me as much. Poor
Emily, she’s cried so hard that paint won’t help
her white eyelashes now.”</p>

<p>The colonel, who had discovered that Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
had been crying herself, looked thoughtful. They
turned and walked through the hall together to the
staircase. Virginia started to ascend—she wanted
to escape—but her grandfather had more news for
her.</p>

<p>“Dan’s a kind of clam,” he observed after a
moment’s pause, “but I got something out of him.
Fanchon has told him her story. He believes that
it will help save Leigh. He’s going to put her on
the stand.”</p>

<p>Virginia, leaning on the banister, blushed again.</p>

<p>“I thought she’d left William,” she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“So she has—so she has; but Dan says she’ll do
anything to save Leigh. She seems to be fond of
that fool kid. Got him under her thumb, I suppose,
and then made him do her bidding. I reckon
she’d better go on the stand. It’s the only thing
she can do. But, by gum, I’m sorry for Johnson
Carter and his wife, and Emily and Dan.”</p>

<p>“And William,” suggested Virginia softly.</p>

<p>“No!” thundered the colonel. “No! I’m not
a mite sorry for that lummox—he went and married
her! He——”</p>

<p>The old man stopped with his mouth open.
Lucas, the negro driver, had just appeared at the
back door, his arms full of green ears of corn.</p>

<p>“Been up de hill, suh,” he explained genially,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
“an’ Col’nel Colfax’s son, he don’ send yo’ all dis
yere corn. Golden Bantam—dat’s what he call it,
same as dey calls dem lil no-account chickens.”</p>

<p>“It looks small,” said the colonel. “How about
that horse? Did you like it, Lucas?”</p>

<p>“Yessuh, I like ’im, but he don’ like me. He’s
very good horse, Pole Star’s grandson, but I
reckon I scared ob ridin’ him. Sam Bun, he Mist’
Colfax’s man—he say dat horse bit four men las’
Saturday week.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want him,” said Virginia laughing.
“Hear any news up there, Lucas? How’s Miss
Sally?”</p>

<p>“Gone to de springs, Miss Jinny. I did heah
on de road back ’bout young Mis’ Carter—de one
dat done got Mist’ Corwin shot.” He looked over
his green corn at the colonel. “She’s stayin’ up
to Quantah’s place now.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” The colonel stared. “Pretty poor place
isn’t it, Lucas?”</p>

<p>“Sho is, suh. Ain’t noffin’ dere now but de
woman, Mis’ Quantah, an’ dat bug-house boy ob
hers. Dey sold de cow las’ week to de butcher.
Ain’t no place fo’ quality nohow. Yessuh, Mis’
Wilyum Carter up dere now. She lef’ Mist’ Wilyum
or Mist’ Wilyum lef’ her, I don’t know—”</p>

<p>“Lucas, you take that corn to the kitchen. I
want some for dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“Yessuh,” said Lucas, and went.</p>

<p>The colonel turned to Virginia.</p>

<p>“That Quantah place is pretty forlorn. Can
that girl be as poor as that? I thought Mrs. Quantah
was about down and out.”</p>

<p>“Why, grandpa, the place is a wreck! There
can’t be a decent room up-stairs!” Virginia’s face
was still flushed, she clung to the banister. “I
can’t understand.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked grave.</p>

<p>“She’s going on the stand for Leigh. The Carters
oughtn’t to allow this.” He turned and laid
his hand on his granddaughter’s shoulder.
“Jinny,” he said quietly. “I reckon we mustn’t
judge it too hard, but—well, I’m beginning to pity
that girl.”</p>

<p>Virginia said nothing. She was afraid that her
grandfather felt her trembling under his hand.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">William Carter</span> spent the days after the shooting
entirely alone in his office at the Payson Building.
He slept there on the old couch, and for the
most part ate there, Moses, the elevator-boy, running
errands for him to the delicatessen store and
then devouring the viands after he had brought
them. For William ate practically nothing,
though he drank a good deal.</p>

<p>Mr. Payson, who had found him once or twice
in a state of stupor, called up Mr. Carter on the
telephone the day before the trial.</p>

<p>“You’d better come over and see William,” he
advised. “He’s in no condition to do business.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, who had just returned to his office
after a long talk with Leigh, was shaken; but he
picked up his hat, clapped it down again on his
gray head, and started determinedly for the Payson
Building. He felt that his cup was full. He
even experienced a sensation of ire at Payson for
having acquired wealth to build this huge edifice
of mottled brick and sandstone.</p>

<p>“Looks like a huge loaf of ginger-bread,” Mr.
Carter grumbled to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>But he was glad that it happened to be in full
blast, as he would have expressed it, and the
throng of shoppers had no time to notice him.
Moses took him up in an elevator that was designated
as “for employees only.” He made some
ado, too, about moving aside a basketful of empty
bottles to make room for his passenger. Mr. Carter
shoved the basket with his foot.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Moses looked plaintive.</p>

<p>“Ain’t had no time to pitch ’em outen heah,
suh. Dey’s from Mist’ Wilyum’s room.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter restrained an impulse to count the
bottles, and said nothing. At the eighth floor
he got out and walked reluctantly across the hall
to his son’s door. He opened it without knocking
and looked in.</p>

<p>William was seated at his desk, his arms hanging
down at his sides and his eyes fixed on the wall
opposite. There was no indication of intemperance
unless it lay in the deathly pallor and the
disheveled hair. Mr. Carter strode over to the
table and struck it loudly with his fist to call attention
to his presence.</p>

<p>“We’d be honored if you’d come home,” he said
dryly. “You’ve nothing to fear there—she’s
cleared out.”</p>

<p>William raised his haggard eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“How about Leigh? I haven’t seen Dan for
days.”</p>

<p>“Dan’s trying to save his brother from”—Mr.
Carter’s voice grew suddenly hoarse—“from
eighteen years’ imprisonment.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” cried William aghast. “They
couldn’t do that—he’s nothing but a kid!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter walked over to the windows and
shut and fastened them; then he picked up his
son’s hat and handed it to him.</p>

<p>“You come home with me,” was all he said.</p>

<p>William went.</p>

<p>His adoring mother received him like the returned
prodigal, and Emily waited on him with
eyes red from weeping. No one mentioned Fanchon;
the family seemed to have resolved to let her
drop out of sight forever. With Daniel’s aid, William
managed to see Leigh that night for the first
time since the shooting.</p>

<p>It was a moment of horrible embarrassment
and humiliation for William. He was shocked,
too, at the sight of the boy’s white face and the
dark rings under his girlish eyes. Leigh had
gone through deep waters on his account, yet it
was one of those things that cannot be talked
about.</p>

<p>“My job, Leigh,” he said laconically. “You
had no business to take it away from me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Leigh blushed like a girl.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t hear Fanchon slandered like that,”
he cried. “I had to do it!”</p>

<p>William bowed his head, looking down at the
floor of the cell. He hadn’t the heart to tell the
boy that he believed the slanders. Curiously
enough, under Leigh’s clear eyes, he felt ashamed
of believing in them; but his inveterate rage
against his wife remained undiminished. She had
deceived him, he no longer believed in her, and he
was furious against her for the ruin she had
wrought. The very fact that he had been head
over ears in love with her embittered him the
more. It was an intolerable humiliation.</p>

<p>He left Leigh in a passion of sorrow and self-accusation,
and went home to spend a sleepless
night. Toward morning, from sheer exhaustion,
he dozed off into troubled dreams. He thought he
had been cast into a fiery furnace along with Shadrach,
Meshech and Abednego; he could see three
shadowy figures moving like giants through fields
of flame. Presently an angel touched him on the
shoulder and called to him—in French. The angel
had the face of Fanchon.</p>

<p>He awoke with a groan and found his mother
standing at the foot of his bed. She had recovered
sufficiently to move about the house now in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
striped calico wrapper that made her look twenty
years older.</p>

<p>“It’s the day of the trial, Willie,” she said
brokenly. “Papa and Dan went an hour ago. Are—are
you going to testify? Dan said he wouldn’t
call you.”</p>

<p>“The State will,” replied William apathetically,
getting out of bed.</p>

<p>His mother looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’re going to call Fanchon,”
she faltered.</p>

<p>He started. For some reason he had never
thought of this, and he felt a pang of horrid dismay.
It couldn’t be that Judge Jessup and Dan
meant to do that. But the State? William experienced
a new and rending sensation. He felt
like a helpless beetle pinned to the board of a naturalist;
he couldn’t escape public dissection.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better not go, Willie,” suggested
his mother fondly. “Emily and I are
going to stay here at the telephone to-day. Papa
promised to ’phone us everything, and we shall
be terribly nervous and frightened. Stay with us,
dear.”</p>

<p>William realized that he was still a boy to her,
and that now, when his unacceptable wife had left
him, he was nearer than ever. Nevertheless, he
began to look for his clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“I shall go straight there, of course,” he said
sharply. “Please tell Miranda I want only a
cup of hot coffee.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Willie, you must eat something!” she cried
tearfully. “You’ll ruin your health—there are
corn muffins, too.”</p>

<p>He had always had a weakness for corn muffins,
and, acting on the advice of Miranda, his mother
had ordered them to console him. But William
would have none of them. He was dressing rapidly,
in a fever of impatience, when Emily arrived
outside his door and put her lips close to the key-hole
to shout to him:</p>

<p>“Papa says you needn’t hurry down there. He
doesn’t think they’ll get a jury until next week.
Dan’s used up one panel already.”</p>

<p>William had not thought of this, and he slackened
his efforts a little only to hear his sister’s return.</p>

<p>“Mama says stay and have some muffins.
They’re lovely and brown—I ate five.”</p>

<p>The fact that murder in the second degree did
not carry the death sentence had reassured Emily’s
hitherto impaired appetite. Like Miranda,
she ate to keep up her spirits.</p>

<p>William swallowed a cup of coffee, and left
with the consciousness that his mother, Emily, and
Miranda considered him on the verge of suicide.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
He made his way to the court-house by the church
lane and the rear alleys. Public curiosity had become
intolerable to him, and he had a horror of
meeting an acquaintance.</p>

<p>It seemed only last week that he had brought
Fanchon up the train platform to meet his father.
He had been proud of her beauty then; he had
thought her unique and fascinating, and he had
even liked the sensation she made in the old humdrum
town. Now, he could not think of her without
a shudder. He felt as if she had pilloried him
in the public square. He would never be able to
endure the place again, nor the people in it. It
was too small. Each man knew all about his
neighbor’s business. He remembered hearing
Judge Jessup say that he found it hard to live in
such a “nosey” community. It even filled William
with intolerant wrath when a group of little pickaninnies
stopped playing to gaze, and he heard the
loud stage whisper:</p>

<p>“Dat’s him!”</p>

<p>The husband of the woman for whom Corwin
had been shot!</p>

<p>He plunged desperately into the basement of the
court-house, and ascended the marble steps to a
pair of swinging baize doors labeled in huge
letters:</p>

<p class="center">CRIMINAL COURT No. 1.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span></p>

<p>The room, a large one at the northeast corner of
the old building, was crowded to suffocation. The
windows were all open, and from them one could
see the sunshine on the broad leaves of the mulberry-tree
in the quadrangle. Judge Barbour, a
cousin of the doctor’s, was on the bench, and William
recognized a group of reporters below him,
on one side. On the other side Daniel was challenging
a juror, his face tense and one long forefinger
pointing at the man.</p>

<p>William had not seen his brother in court for a
long time, and he had a curious feeling that this
white-faced, tense lawyer wasn’t his brother at all.
It seemed to him that there had been a metamorphosis,
that some magic had been at work, that
this wasn’t lame Dan, the brother whom he had
rather discounted. Here was a face so pre-eminently
a face of power that William gaped at it,
as the pickaninnies outside the court-house had
gaped at him. He could feel, too, that Daniel was
holding the crowded room, and that the men and
boys on the window-sills, and out roosting in the
mulberry branches that overlooked the court-room,
were all drawn by the magic of his tongue.</p>

<p>Slowly, deliberately, using all his privilege of
challenge, Daniel was picking his jury, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Judge Jessup, senior counsel for the defense, sat
between Mr. Carter and the prisoner at the dock.
Reluctantly, with a feeling of personal shame,
William turned his eyes slowly toward his young
brother—the boy who was suffering vicariously
for him.</p>

<p>Leigh’s youth seemed appalling in that place.
The boy, with his white face and his dark-ringed
eyes, looked fifteen. He had a long lock of light
brown hair that was usually tossed back from his
white forehead—a Byronic effect that Leigh secretly
cherished. It was hanging down now, limp
and disheveled, and he kept clutching at his necktie
with nervous fingers; but there was a light in
his eyes, a singular light, as if he saw something
inspiring and beautiful.</p>

<p>William tried to follow his glance, to discover
what had inspired that rapt look, but the crowd
was so great that he could not even get through it
to sit beside his father. He found standing-room
near the door, where he seemed to be unnoticed,
and watched the proceedings with a growing feeling
of shame that he was not in Leigh’s place.</p>

<p>Daniel was engaged now in a tilt with the commonwealth
attorney, Major Haskins, a man who
William knew had once quarreled with his father,
and who was known to be vindictive. Haskins
was flushed and excited, declaiming loudly, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Daniel, keeping his temper admirably, scored
again and again. It was the case of a skilled
toreador baiting a bull. Major Haskins, like the
finest bulls in the arena, charged in a straight line,
never swerving, and, like the toreador, Daniel
dodged lightly on first one side and then the other,
parrying the attack but goading the enemy.</p>

<p>Something in the extreme dexterity of the goading
surprised William again.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Dan had it in him,” he thought
with an accession of unexpected pride in this taciturn
brother, who had suffered so long and so silently.
Then he heard an excited whisper from a
woman in front of him.</p>

<p>“There she is—the dancer! Look—over to the
right—they say she’s going on the stand!”</p>

<p>William shrank as if from a physical blow, and
his sensitive egotism shivered. This, then, was to
be his crowning humiliation, this crowd gathered
to stare at his wife!</p>

<p>Of course Leigh had been looking at her; he
might have known it. The boy was a fool about
her, as he himself had been a fool. William felt
an unbearable sensation of suffocation; the air of
the crowded room was unfit to breathe. People
had found him out, too. The companion of the
woman who had whispered so loudly had spotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
him. They were looking back covertly over their
shoulders and talking in audible undertones.</p>

<p>“What d’you suppose he was doing?”</p>

<p>“That’s her husband—back there.”</p>

<p>“Not really! Oh, my——”</p>

<p>“Say! Pull Jenny’s dress——”</p>

<p>“She’ll want to see him.”</p>

<p>William turned, pushed past the men in the
doorway, and almost staggered into the corridor.
It was absolutely empty. Every living soul who
could squeeze into the court-room had done so.
A short flight of marble steps descended to a door
which opened on the quadrangle and he could see
the sunshine on the lowest step. He started down,
bent on escape, and came face to face with Colonel
Denbigh.</p>

<p>The old man, attired in a light gray summer suit
with a white waistcoat and a broad straw hat,
looked like the personification of an untroubled
conscience. He held out a friendly hand.</p>

<p>“How are you, William? I came down to”—he
hesitated and smiled gravely—“to give your
father and Leigh my moral support. Can’t seem
to do anything else, can I? Anything for you?”
he added, after a moment’s farther hesitation.</p>

<p>William shook his head, turning a deep red.</p>

<p>“I ought to be in Leigh’s place,” he said
chokingly, “but I’m worse off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>The colonel gave him a keen look. It was impossible
not to see that the young man’s position
was heartrending, and he pitied him. At the same
time he still felt a righteous indignation against
Fanchon’s husband.</p>

<p>“By gum, it serves him right,” he thought.</p>

<p>Then he was so ashamed of himself that he
shook hands with William again. There didn’t
seem to be anything else to do.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and sit by your father—if I can get
there,” he said kindly. “I hope your mother’s
better. Bearing up, eh?”</p>

<p>“She’s better,” said William thickly, averting
his eyes. “It’s intolerable to me, Colonel Denbigh,
that she should have to suffer so about Leigh
on my account. If the boy had only come straight
to me!” he added with suppressed passion, his lip
quivering suddenly like a woman’s on the verge of
tears.</p>

<p>The colonel nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I know—but it’s spilt milk, William. We’ll
hope for the best. They tell me Dan’s a smart
fellow. Going to be the best lawyer in this town,
Judge Jessup says. He’ll get his brother off.”</p>

<p>“That won’t save my face,” William replied
bitterly, plunging abruptly down the steps and out
into the quadrangle.</p>

<p>The colonel, left alone, stood a moment looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
after him, considering him. Come to look at it,
he thought, it was a pretty bad place—even for a
lummox. He had always thought well of William,
he had once imagined him as the possible husband
of Virginia, but now——</p>

<p>The colonel tugged at his white mustache with
a grim face. He was thinking of Virginia’s face
on the stairs, the soft sadness of that profile.</p>

<p>“It can’t be that Jinny cares!” he cried indignantly
under his breath.</p>

<p>Then, unable to endure the idea, he swung open
the baize doors and worked his way into the
crowded court-room. There was a little stir in it
now, an air of relief. The twelfth juror had just
been accepted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> trial dragged its way through the rest of
the afternoon and all the next day, the colonel
sitting dutifully beside his good friend, Johnson
Carter. The old man leaned forward on his cane,
an interested spectator, hoping in his heart that
he was thus killing off any gossip about that old
attachment between William Carter and his granddaughter.
It was from him that Virginia got her
news of the proceedings, and an account of Daniel
as a lawyer.</p>

<p>“Say, Jinny, that boy’s as smart as a steel
trap,” said the colonel delightedly. “If William
had had half his gumption, he wouldn’t be in the
fix he’s in now. You ought to see Dan get a jury.
By gum, I had to laugh at the way he got Haskins
on the hip every time. Got the indictment in the
second degree, too, Jessup says.”</p>

<p>“It would have been terrible to try that boy for
murder in the first degree,” said Virginia. “Why,
grandpa, I don’t believe Major Haskins would do
it.”</p>

<p>“Jinny, Haskins would indict his own grandmother
for grand larceny if he thought it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
get him a seat in the Legislature,” retorted the
colonel with asperity. “I reckon I know Jim
Haskins!”</p>

<p>At which Virginia had to laugh; but she felt
very little like laughing as the trial dragged on.
She went over twice to carry flowers, and what
comfort she could to Mrs. Carter and Emily. The
last time she regretted it, for Mrs. Carter lost
her head and sobbed on the young comforter’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jinny, if William had only married you!”
she gasped.</p>

<p>Virginia went away with a red face. It seemed
to her that the thing pursued her, whichever way
she turned. The rest of that day she devoted to
close attention to the household affairs.</p>

<p>“I shan’t be home until late, Jinny,” her grandfather
’phoned her during the afternoon. “I
reckon it’ll go to the jury to-day. Say, Jinny!”</p>

<p>“Yes, grandpa, I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. William Carter’s going on the stand.
Jinny, the court-room’s packed, just like sardines
in a box. They’re sitting on the window-sills this
minute. Don’t you wait dinner if I’m late.”</p>

<p>Virginia hung up the receiver with a pale face.
She had heard an account of William in the corridor
from her grandfather, and she had divined
how William felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>The old man’s robust anger against “that lummox”
for spoiling his own life did not reach Virginia.
She remembered William’s boyish figure
trudging home from school with her books, William
reading the “Iliad” with her, and William,
when he told her that he loved her. It had all
been a youthful affair. She knew that, so she told
herself; but she could never quite forget it when
she thought of him. She thought of it now, and
tried in vain to picture him sitting there, helplessly,
and hearing all the whispers and gossiping
when his wife went on the stand to try to save his
brother—for such a cause!</p>

<p>Virginia, who had been standing by the telephone,
walked slowly across the room to a window
that overlooked the town. It was a spot that
showed the old place in its most homelike and
friendly aspect, with its wreath of foliage—now,
in midsummer, at the full height of its beauty—and
its background of lovely hills. She could see
from here the long gable of Dr. Barbour’s roof,
and over there the chimneys of the Paysons’ more
pretentious mansion. Behind the tall poplars
was the Carter house, and yonder the cross-tipped
spire of the church. Beyond these she caught a
glimpse of a distant cupola, and knew it to be the
apex of the court-house. A pleasant, warm haze
hung in the summer atmosphere, and she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
hear the tinkling bell on a passing peddler’s cart.</p>

<p>Virginia tried not to think. She did not want
to think of William watching his wife go on the
stand for such a cause; but as she leaned forward
her hands gripped the window-sill until the
delicate knuckles whitened.</p>

<p>She was still there when Lucas came driving
back from town. He had taken the colonel to
court in an antiquated rockaway that belonged in
the family. He was returning alone now, with a
number of bundles in the rockaway, topped by a
large ripe watermelon. Virginia watched him
drive in the gate and on to the stables.</p>

<p>Presently he came along on foot, with his watermelon
on his shoulder. Virginia called to him.</p>

<p>“Where did you get your melon, Lucas?”</p>

<p>“Presen’ fo’ de col’nel, Miss Jinny.” Lucas
turned his shoulder around for her to look at the
melon. “Ain’t he a beauty! Sho’ he is! Mist’
Payson, he give him to me. He say: ‘Luke, yo’
take him to de col’nel fo’ a presen’.’”</p>

<p>Virginia admired the melon.</p>

<p>“Grandfather isn’t coming back until late,” she
said. “Did he tell you when to come for him,
Lucas?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Jinny, he ain’t a comin’ till it’s over,
I reckon. Yo’ oughter see dat court-house! Ain’t
no gettin’ inter it. Mis’ Wilyum Carter, she testifyin’.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Seems like it mus’ be motion-picture show,
Miss Jinny. I saw Mist’ Wilyum Carter myse’f.
He was goin’ in ayonnah, an’ he look—Miss Jinny,
he look like one ob dese yere white-spine cucumbers—he
ain’t got no more colluh ’cept green.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Lucas. Take that watermelon
down to the kitchen and get Lucy to put it on ice.
The colonel may want it when he comes home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Jinny, I sho’ will. I’s— Say, Miss
Jinny, Mirandy, Miz Carter’s help, she say Mist’
Wilyum gwine to get divorcement.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about Miranda,” said Virginia
hastily. “You get that melon out of the sun.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t gwine to get hurt in de sun, Miss
Jinny. He’s jus’ ripe—yo’ heah him?” Lucas
gave the melon a scientific tap. “Yo’ heah him?
He’s all right, he sho’ is, Miss Jinny. Mirandy,
she say Mist’ Carter—de ole man—he raise ruction
’bout it when Mist’ Leigh shoot dat man——”</p>

<p>“Lucas,” said Virginia, “I never listen to gossip.
You take that melon to the kitchen!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Jinny, yes, miss, I’s goin’, but
Mirandy——”</p>

<p>Virginia thrust her fingers into her ears and
retreated. Half laughing, half crying, she threw
herself into a chair beside the piano. Her heart
was beating stormily, and she hated herself for it.
Then she lifted her eyes slowly, reluctantly, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
little picture of William as a child. It still hung
beside her piano. The sight of it filled her mind
with a strange tumult of thoughts; yet, strangely
enough, the vision she saw most clearly was
Daniel’s face of pain as she stood beside him, her
hand on his shoulder. She blushed at the thought
of it now.</p>

<p>At that very moment, when Virginia sat with her
eyes hidden in her hands, trying to shut out the
little tormenting imps that thrust that picture
before her, a stranger scene was being staged in
the old court-house. The court-room was so
densely crowded that even the sweet summer air
which came in through the open windows grew
close and stifling. The window-sills were full, and
the trees outside bore human fruit upon the
branches that commanded the upper panes of
those windows.</p>

<p>The crowd dimmed the light like a flock of locusts
darkening the sun in the east, and some one
had lit a green-shaded lamp on the recorder’s
desk. The light from it flared up on the face of
the prisoner—a pale, boyish face with girlish eyes.
Near him sat his family. Mrs. Carter had summoned
all her courage to be with her boy at the
supreme moment, and Emily was there, too, with
tearful eyes and a red nose, looking very unlike
the Emily who had painted her lashes. Beside her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
sat William Carter, then his father and Colonel
Denbigh.</p>

<p>William sat with his eyes down and his hands
clenched on the arms of his chair. He never
looked up, not even when Daniel and Judge Jessup
scored a victory and got Mrs. William Carter’s
testimony admitted as being relevant to the defense.
Bernstein had already told his story—a
story of the scandal, and of Corwin’s slanders.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Carter hardly dared to look up. She
had a terrible sensation of sinking and falling
through space, common to nightmare. William’s
wife talked about like that! She put out a groping
hand, caught Emily’s hot, moist fingers, and held
them. They didn’t dare even to look at each
other, and Emily sniffed hard to keep back the
tears. It was the first time she had heard the
details.</p>

<p>The prisoner went white; he realized suddenly
that his reckless act had given the scandal huge
publicity, that it was ruinous to the woman whom
he had tried to defend. Humiliation swept over
him, and he sank down in his chair, staring
straight in front of him. Like William, he did not
look up when Fanchon was called.</p>

<p>There was an expectant stir, followed by a hush.
A small figure in black, with a huge hat and a floating
veil, came slowly forward and took the oath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
Judge Jessup stepped gallantly aside, and Daniel
Carter, very pale, very relentless, took the witness.</p>

<p>For the first time William looked up. He
looked persistently at his brother, and seemed to
be trying to avoid looking at his wife; but he was
aware of her, even before she began to answer
Daniel’s terrible questions that seemed to drive
straight into her past, to lay it open and set it,
throbbing and pitiful and full of pain, before the
jury, before the packed court-room, before the little
world in which the Carters had always lived
quiet and sober and respected.</p>

<p>At first William did not listen. He was filled
with a blind fury that Daniel should do it, that his
own brother should drag him out into public view
as a young man who had made a fool of himself
and married a dancer. Then her sweet, vibrating,
captivating voice, with a French note in it and the
spell of sex, reached him, and he had to listen.</p>

<p>First came the story of their marriage—he knew
that; then the story of her birth and childhood—he
knew that in part, and it was sad. The stillness
in the room affected him. He began to feel
the wave of sympathy rising. They liked her;
she was winning them. Something stirred in his
heart. His old passion for her was not yet cold,
and that voice—that delightful, hurrying voice—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> 
couldn’t shut it out. Reluctantly he raised his
eyes.</p>

<p>Row upon row of faces! He had never seen so
many faces. He knew many of them. His old
friends and his acquaintances were there, and
strangers. Then he heard Daniel’s voice, and it
cut like a knife-thrust:</p>

<p>“And your first meeting with this man Corwin?”</p>

<p>William turned and looked at her then. The
light from the little lamp on the recorder’s desk
was playing strange tricks. It caught Fanchon’s
face now and illuminated it—a face small and pale
and piquant, with the eyes of a wild fawn, the
adorable face that William had seen first in Paris—only
a few months ago!</p>

<p>He gazed fixedly at it, breathing hard. The old
spell laid hold of him, for she had turned and was
looking at him. There was an appeal in that
look, almost a cry for help, and it held him.</p>

<p>Then he heard her voice again, and he began to
listen, in a dull way at first, and then with growing
amazement, with rising fury. She was telling her
story—her pitiful, sordid story. Women wept;
but there was nothing touching in it to her husband.
It was a revelation, a cruel, sordid revelation
of a lie. She had lied to him and deceived
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>Pity died in his heart, the spell broke, he leaned
back in his chair with folded arms and regarded
her coldly and scornfully and bitterly. His look
worked upon her like something alien and fierce
and inimical; and she broke under it. At the very
moment when it seemed as if she had planned it
to work upon the jury, Fanchon broke down—broke
down into pitiful, passionate tears.</p>

<p>An hour later—after Major Haskins had tried
in vain to destroy her story—Daniel rose in his
place, and simply, eloquently, without gesture or
oratory, he made the plea that won him fame—a
brother’s plea for a brother. So eloquent was it
that Judge Jessup never spoke at all. There
seemed nothing else to say.</p>

<p>Major Haskins summed up for the prosecution.
He did it with acrimony, in the old way, tearing
Fanchon’s past to pieces and fairly pinning the
Carter family, like a lot of butterflies stuck on the
board of the cruelest of naturalists, and leaving
Mr. Carter gasping with mute fury. Then, at a
late hour, Judge Barbour charged the jury, and
William Carter rose, white as a sheet, and left the
court-house.</p>

<p>Virginia, having eaten her dinner in solitary
state, sat on the piazza waiting for her grandfather.
It was late in August, and the sweet darkness
fell early. She watched the earth grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
darker and darker until the hilltops stood out,
etched in black against a pale sky. Behind her
the old house was dark except for the light in
the hall, and silent except for the occasional sound
of mellow laughter from the kitchen, where the
negroes awaited their share of Mr. Payson’s
prize watermelon.</p>

<p>Virginia sat very still as the night deepened.
The air was full of delicate fragrance from the
flower-beds below her feet. Far off at first, and
then nearer at hand, the insects began their incessant
clamor, which seemed only to make the stillness
more complete by contrast. Above, the pale
sky began to darken, and one by one the stars
came out, softly obscured by clouds and shining
through them, as the candles at an altar sometimes
shine through a fog of incense.</p>

<p>Time passed; the old clock in the hall chimed.
Virginia counted the strokes—ten. How late the
colonel was! Then she heard the sound of wheels
on the gravel outside the main gate, and Lucas
drove the rockaway up to the front door. Her
grandfather’s tall head appeared at the steps. He
stopped to say a word to Lucas and then came
slowly up. Not until then did Virginia rise from
her corner.</p>

<p>“Grandpa—is it over?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>He was startled; then he smiled, taking off his
hat.</p>

<p>“How cool it is out here—we were baked down-town!
I reckon I’ll sit with you, Jinny.”</p>

<p>“Have you dined? Mr. Payson sent a watermelon;
it’s on ice for you.”</p>

<p>“I dined with Payson down-town. No, let the
watermelon wait. What did you say, Jinny? No,
it isn’t over. We waited, but they’ve locked up the
jury for the night, so I came home.”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had dropped into her seat again,
was trying to be calm.</p>

<p>“There’s a disagreement, then?”</p>

<p>The colonel nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I reckon there is. Haskins made a big fight,
Jinny, but”—the old man drew a long breath—“by
gum, I’ve heard that girl’s story—Fanchon’s.
She told it on the stand!”</p>

<p>He stopped, drawing a deep breath. He seemed
to be contemplating something amazing. Virginia
said nothing. She clasped her hands tightly in
her lap, looking not at him but at the constellation
in front of her. It happened to be the Scorpion,
and she began to count the stars silently.</p>

<p>“By gum!” said the colonel again.</p>

<p>Plato came to the door.</p>

<p>“Col’nel, have a julep, suh, or dat watermelon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Nothing at all; I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p>The colonel waved him away; then he turned to
Virginia and told her Fanchon’s story. He told
it better than she could have hoped to have him
tell it.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t been a bad girl, Jinny. That was a
relief to me. Haskins tried to slur her, but Daniel
brought it out point by point. Married at fifteen,
and her old aunt swore that she was eighteen to
get money out of it, by gum!”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had listened with emotion,
shivered.</p>

<p>“I think it was cruel, grandfather, to make her
tell it.”</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>“Not to save Leigh, though. Lordy, Jinny, I
never saw Leigh look younger, except that day I
caught him with the lollypop. It ought to save
him.” He added reluctantly, with a fine sense of
justice: “Jinny, I can’t blame William. He got
up and left the court. Mr. Carter told me about
it. He never knew a darned thing about his wife
being a divorced woman, nor about Corwin, nor
anything. She lied to him, Jinny.” The colonel
leaned back and thrust his thumbs into the armholes
of his waistcoat. “I’m kind of sorry for
him. He’s going to get a divorce, so they say;
but the girl—Fanchon, I mean—she’s tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
save Leigh, and she’s about ruined herself. Jinny,
I felt as if it was heroic. I—by gum, come inside,
I can’t stand those crickets to-night! They’re on
my nerves—shouting ‘Here again, here again!’
Jinny, I’m sorry for them all, but I’m a darned
sight sorrier for the girl!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Leigh’s</span> acquitted!” Judge Jessup, with a
flushed face, bent over to whisper it to Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>In the crowd and confusion of the court-room
she seemed too dazed to hear the foreman of the
jury as he answered the judge’s interrogation.
She looked up at the old lawyer, her lip quivering
like a child.</p>

<p>“Oh, judge! Really and truly?”</p>

<p>He nodded, swallowing a lump in his throat, for
Mrs. Carter collapsed, crying like a baby on Emily’s
shoulder, and Judge Jessup found it a moving
spectacle. He had once had a devoted mother
himself.</p>

<p>There was a crowd around Leigh, old friends
and sympathizers, and—to Mr. Carter’s horror—newspaper
reporters. It made the perspiration
stand out in beads on his forehead.</p>

<p>“Heavens, I should think we’d had enough
without that,” he groaned inwardly, and then he
caught sight of his eldest son’s face.</p>

<p>William was standing behind Leigh, his arms
folded and his eyes down. It seemed to his father
that he had never seen such wreckage in a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
man’s face before. It was as hard as flint. The
square jaws were set and the brows bent. William
had been drinking the cup of humiliation to the
dregs.</p>

<p>“Serves him right,” his father thought hotly,
and then: “She’s saved Leigh!”</p>

<p>That sent a thrill of remorse through him, and
his eyes followed the line of reporters, which led,
like a trail of ants after a dead beetle, straight to
the small figure in black on the other side of the
court-room. Mr. Carter, perspiring freely and
with a sinking heart, beheld his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Fanchon was as white as William, but those
lovely, fawn-like eyes were soft, appealing, almost
childlike. She scarcely heeded the reporters. She
seemed unwilling to speak to any one, and, as Mr.
Carter looked at her, she began to make her way
toward Leigh.</p>

<p>There was a little hum of excited comment as
she moved, and the light grace and beauty of the
small, black-clad figure had never been more
marked. She wore the same big, black hat, and her
veil, floating from the wide brim, formed a
shadowy background for the small, pointed face—the
face that had never shown more fully than
it did at that moment its subtle, tantalizing, inimitable
charm. Mr. Carter saw it reluctantly,
and Leigh saw it with boyish devotion as she came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
up. They said little. She gave both her small
hands to the boy.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Leigh!” she whispered, a sob in
her throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fanchon!”</p>

<p>That was all he could gasp out, his eyes too
misted to see the beauty of hers. Their hands
clung together.</p>

<p>“Dear boy!” Fanchon murmured. “I can’t
thank you—you believed in me! I shall remember—<i>toujours,
toujours</i>!”</p>

<p>He wrung her hands. Then some one else came
up to speak to him, and she passed on.</p>

<p>Turning from Leigh, she came face to face with
her husband. For a moment she seemed to hold
her breath. In the crowd no one saw them but
Daniel, who had just come back to sit by his
mother and Emily. Fanchon stood still, and her
hand went to her side with an involuntary gesture
of pain. For an instant she looked at William, but
he never raised his eyes. He stood motionless,
looking down. There was no sign that he was even
aware of her, except a perceptible hardening of
the mouth. She turned away blindly, dropping her
veil over her face, and started toward the door.</p>

<p>Daniel pressed his mother’s arm.</p>

<p>“Mother, you ought to thank Fanchon. She
saved Leigh. It’s been terrible for her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Me? Oh, I can’t!” Mrs. Carter’s lip trembled
worse than ever. “It—it wouldn’t do any good.”</p>

<p>“Mother! Don’t you understand? She saved
Leigh.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter started to her feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, I’ll—I’ll try!” she stammered.</p>

<p>Daniel seized her arm and led her toward her
daughter-in-law. They had to push through the
crowd to a side door behind the witness-stand, for
Fanchon had already reached it. Her veil was
down, and, as Daniel spoke her name, she stood
motionless, waiting. There was a difficult moment,
and then Mrs. Carter’s tremulous, frightened
voice:</p>

<p>“Dan says you saved my boy——”</p>

<p>She stopped. Fanchon had lifted her veil with
a tragic gesture and looked at Mrs. Carter, passionate
scorn in her beautiful eyes. For a moment
she said nothing. Her whole form seemed to
quiver from head to foot; then her pale lips moved
at first without words.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it for you,” she said bitterly at
last, “nor for your son, nor for any of you—only
for Leigh! <i>Adieu, madame!</i>”</p>

<p>She turned with a gesture at once tragic and
beautiful, the gesture of an actress, made passionate
by the bitterness of a woman.</p>

<p>A bailiff held the door open for her, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
after her admiringly and curiously, but without
deference. Daniel and his mother, watching her,
saw the small black figure disappear down the long
corridor, saw it silhouetted a moment against the
daylight at some distant door, and then it was
gone.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, take me home!” gasped Mrs. Carter.
“I haven’t done anything wrong, but I—I feel like
a pickpocket. She makes me feel that way!”</p>

<p>Daniel made no reply. He was aware, at the
moment, that his father, bent on getting Leigh
home, was fighting his way out with the boy.
Judge Jessup had ’phoned for two taxis, as one
would not hold the reunited Carters.</p>

<p>“The jury couldn’t agree at first,” the judge explained
joyfully; “but Fanchon’s story did it.
When they talked it over, they agreed on acquittal.
Good thing, eh?”</p>

<p>He tried to be jovial, for he saw the strain, and
he was glad when the two loaded taxis disappeared
in the dust of the highroad. It seemed to him
that, as a family, they were not joyful.</p>

<p>“Willie looks like a death’s head at the feast,”
the old man thought, and turned to shake hands
with Colonel Denbigh. “I didn’t do it. No, sir,
Daniel Carter did. He’s the coming man. You
watch him, Colonel.”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>“I’ll back Dan,” he said. “But how about that
poor girl, Jessup?”</p>

<p>The judge pursed his lips.</p>

<p>“William’s going to get a divorce. Do you
reckon he realizes that she gave up everything to
save his brother? He’s turning her out for it,
eh? Looks that way, far as I can see.”</p>

<p>“By gum!” said the colonel softly, and he
averted his eyes.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then the two old friends
went silently over to the club for luncheon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Carters had taken Leigh home.
Distributed in two taxicabs they arrived in a state
of suppressed emotion difficult to describe; but,
once in the house, the ice thawed. For the second
time Mrs. Carter became hysterical, Emily wept on
his neck, and Miranda started in on a wild effort
to make preserved cherry tarts in time for
luncheon.</p>

<p>Awaiting this event, all the members of the
family gathered in the library, sitting around
Leigh in a semicircle and looking at him, much as
they might have gazed at a wanderer rescued from
the perils of some distant and unknown clime.
Leigh, who had been thoroughly lectured by his
father on the way home, looked limp and white.
He sat in Mr. Carter’s large chair and clung to the
arms with his thin, white hands, the lock falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
low on his forehead and the rims of his eyes suspiciously
red. Mr. Carter, trembling with joy at
his son’s release, had nevertheless exploded with
long-suppressed wrath.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a lesson now, young man,” he had
said hoarsely. “Mind you profit by it. If I catch
you with shooting-irons again, I’ll lam you for it
if you’re as big as the house!”</p>

<p>Leigh, who had indeed had a bitter experience,
had made no reply. He was aware of Daniel’s significant
silence on the other side. It was a painful
moment, only alleviated by his mother’s fond ecstasy
and Emily’s sobs. Those two, at least, were
glad to get him back on any terms.</p>

<p>Now, in the library, he sat looking about at the
family circle with a feeling of pitiful embarrassment.
It was almost worse than sitting in the
dock. He lifted his eyes reluctantly and found his
father still explosive between relief and long-bottled
anger. His mother and Emily were still sniffing,
while Daniel was engaged at the table, making
some notes.</p>

<p>In the corner, alone and morose, sat William.
Leigh turned his eyes that way only once. He
found his brother’s haggard face unpleasant to
look at. He sat again with his eyes down, moving
one foot occasionally, or gripping nervously at the
arms of his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>Miranda came to the door, her brown face
wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>“Lunch is ready, Mis’ Carter, an’ dem tarts
came out right smart, yes’m!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rose and laid her hand on Leigh’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come, darling,” she said fondly. “We’ve got
a nice lunch and some cherry tarts for you.”</p>

<p>The boy rose awkwardly, and his mother led him
along, clinging to him, doting upon him, while the
rest of the family trailed in the rear. As they entered
the dining-room, Leigh counted the places.</p>

<p>“Sit right down here beside mamma,” cooed
his mother, patting the chair on her right. “I’ve
got lamb chops and green peas—just for you,
dear!”</p>

<p>Leigh stood with his hand on the back of his
chair, and glanced questioningly up and down the
table.</p>

<p>“Where’s Fanchon?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>There was that kind of silence that seems to be
audible. It was Mr. Carter who answered him,
frowning heavily.</p>

<p>“She left us some time ago,” he said shortly.
“I wish you to know, Leigh, that—this family’s
done with her. Understand?”</p>

<p>Leigh caught his breath, and his mouth fell
open. He stared at William, but William was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
looking down at his plate. The only sign he gave
of having heard his father’s remark was the deep
red flush that went up to his hair. Leigh remained
standing, though his mother clutched at his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Sit down, dear,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said in his high, boyish voice, his
lips shaking, “she saved me. Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Mr. Carter with an impatient
gesture. “We’ll talk of that another time.”</p>

<p>He fixed an irate eye on his son, and the boy
collapsed into his chair; but he scarcely tasted
his food, nor did William eat more than a few
mouthfuls. The two played with their forks and
avoided looking at each other.</p>

<p>Leigh was panting with anger against William.
He understood now what had happened. William
was deserting Fanchon because of Leigh’s act.
Instead of protecting her, he had ruined her. The
boy could not eat. His food strangled him. Mrs.
Carter hurried on the cherry tarts, and Miranda
bore them in on a tray, her face beaming.</p>

<p>“Look, Leigh!” cried his mother. “Miranda
made these for you.”</p>

<p>The boy raised his shy eyes to the cook’s face.</p>

<p>“You’re very good to me, Miranda,” he managed
to say.</p>

<p>Miranda, with her quick racial sympathy, nearly
dropped the tray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“I declar’ to goodness if he ain’t gwine to cry
in those tarts fo’ sho’!” she said to herself and
cast an anxious look at Mrs. Carter’s troubled
face.</p>

<p>At this juncture, William, who felt himself to
be a death’s head at the feast, rose abruptly and
left the room. A moment later the startled family
heard the front door close behind him. Emily
slipped out of her seat and ran to the window,
coming back just as Miranda returned to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“He’s gone to the Denbighs,” Emily announced
in a stage whisper in her mother’s ear. “I just
knew he would.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emmy, hush!” Mrs. Carter said, looking
shocked.</p>

<p>“He’s gone there—I watched him,” said Emily,
helping herself to more cherry tarts.</p>

<p>More might have followed but for the fortunate
return of Miranda. As she came back, Daniel,
having finished his meal, rose slowly and started
for the door.</p>

<p>“Dan,” said his father, looking around at him
for the first time. “Jessup says you won the case.
He thinks you’re a great lawyer. I’m proud of
you, my son!”</p>

<p>Daniel’s face flushed; he understood the break
in the older man’s voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“Thank you,” he said simply. “I’m sorry I
had to do what I did.”</p>

<p>His father nodded his head gravely.</p>

<p>“You finished her. It was a bit cruel, but it had
to be done.”</p>

<p>Daniel’s flush deepened. He seemed about to
speak, then hesitated and said nothing. They
heard him slowly ascending the stairs to his room.</p>

<p>“He’s going to be a great lawyer, papa,” said
Mrs. Carter with a flash of pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter nodded his head gravely, assenting,
his eyes on Leigh.</p>

<p>Daniel went heavily up-stairs to his room. He
tried not to think of what Emily had said, but he
couldn’t shut it out of his mind. His thoughts
kept hovering back to it, like wretched singed
moths making their last fascinated plunge for the
flame of the candle; the plunge that was sure to
take their remaining wings off.</p>

<p>He shut the door of his room and walked slowly
across to the window opposite. He had had this
room from his boyhood. At first he had shared it
with William, but the elder brother had been promoted
to a better apartment when he began to
succeed at Payson’s. Through long months of illness,
after the fall that lamed him, Daniel had remained
in the small upper room where the slant of
the gable made a queer triangle that couldn’t be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
decorated. The furniture was simple enough and
rather sparse, but he had put up some bookshelves
for himself, and they were well filled now with
books on common law. Still hanging beside the
bed was the picture of Virginia that he had taken
from the library; but he did not look at it now.</p>

<p>He went to the window and opened the shutters
wide, disclosing a square of sky where the white
clouds floated; but he did not look up. In spite of
himself he looked down. His window commanded
a view of Denbigh Crossing, and involuntarily his
eyes turned in that direction. He saw nothing but
the thick foliage of a group of chestnuts, and the
winding road disappearing under the arches of
their wide branches.</p>

<p>He stood for some time looking gloomily at the
prospect. He knew intuitively how his brother
felt. William wanted to grovel in the dirt at
Virginia’s feet and beg her pardon; but would he
dare to do it? Daniel remembered Virginia sitting
at the piano with the childish face of William
in its frame above her head. Daniel had never
doubted that she loved his brother.</p>

<p>Then the scene in the court-room came back to
him, and Fanchon’s small, quivering face. It
had wrung his heart to drag her story from her,
even to save Leigh; but he had done it—without
mercy, too. And now——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>His thoughts broke off suddenly, for the door
opened, and Leigh came in and shut it behind
him. The boy was white and shaken. He put out
an unsteady hand and clutched at the back of a
chair.</p>

<p>“Dan,” he said hoarsely, “what have they done
to her? Where’s Fanchon?”</p>

<p>Daniel laid his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Leigh,” he said kindly.</p>

<p>The boy obeyed him awkwardly. He sat there
staring at his own feet, unwilling to look at his
brother.</p>

<p>“Leigh,” said Daniel, “it’s none of our business—it’s
William’s.”</p>

<p>“They’ve quarreled, and it’s not her fault. You
know it, Dan. We’ve all been dreadful to her!”</p>

<p>Daniel, who was still standing, looking down at
him, was silent a moment; then he spoke slowly.</p>

<p>“I think you’re right, Leigh, we have been; but
there’s another side to this. She wouldn’t tell me
where she was staying. She came to court for
your sake, but she’s done with the rest of us,
Leigh.”</p>

<p>Leigh flared up.</p>

<p>“Emmy says William’s going to divorce her and
marry Virginia Denbigh!”</p>

<p>Daniel went white.</p>

<p>“Emily has no right to say that.” Involuntarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
his hands clenched at his sides, but he gripped
himself. “You’ve had a lesson, Leigh. You
keep your hands off!”</p>

<p>The boy rose sullenly, his face still flushed.</p>

<p>“I owe her everything,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not quite,” Daniel retorted dryly. “You owe
something to Judge Jessup and the jury.”</p>

<p>Leigh seemed to be deaf to this. He went
sulkily to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>“I think William’s a brute,” he remarked in a
low voice. “She loves him—I know she loves him,
and she’s his wife!”</p>

<p>He went out and slammed the door.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia</span> hung up the telephone receiver with
an expression of keen relief. She had just heard
of Leigh’s acquittal.</p>

<p>“Dan got him off!” the colonel told her jubilantly.
“I knew he would! Say, Jinny, I shan’t
be home for lunch; going over to the club with
Payson and Jessup.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled to herself. She knew how the
old man would enjoy it, and she did not care for
any luncheon herself. She told Plato so, half an
hour later. The old man retired grumbling.</p>

<p>“’Deed, Miss Jinny, yo’ be sick. I’m gwine to
tell de col’nel!” But she only laughed at him.
She was, in fact, too nervous to eat. It seemed as
if food would choke her.</p>

<p>She knew everything that had taken place in
that court-house almost as well as if she had been
there. The colonel had been very vivid in his talk,
and she had spoken once over the ’phone with
Mrs. Carter and once with Emily. On all these occasions
she had heard the amazing fact that Fanchon’s
story on the stand had been a surprise to
her husband. In other words, poor William had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
been deceived, Mrs. Carter declared, by a designing
little minx, and his life ruined! This cry of
maternal anguish went to the listener’s heart, for
Virginia had known William from childhood, and
she understood, even more keenly than his mother,
the humiliation he had suffered in court.</p>

<p>She moved restlessly about the house, trying not
to think of it. She had gathered flowers in the
morning, and could not make the garden another
means of diverting her mind, so she tried to
answer some long-neglected letters.</p>

<p>This failed her, too, after a while, and she went
into the old drawing-room, which at this hour was
carefully shaded from the sun. Opening a shutter,
she let in a flood of golden light. It shot
across the room like the fiery lance of a crusader,
its radiant tip striking on the ivory keys of her old
piano. Virginia walked in it, watching the light
catch on the white folds of her skirt. She sat down
dreamily at the piano and began to play. She
played without her notes, and unconsciously her
fingers strayed into old, half-forgotten tunes.</p>

<p>She began to be quite happy. She had not
played these tunes for years, and they brought
back pictures, fragmentary bits of things, and
voices and laughter. She had played that one for
a dance when her grandfather had given her a
birthday party at seventeen, and this one for old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
Judge Jessup because his wife used to like it.
This was the one that William liked. She played
it affectionately and lingeringly. She liked it herself,
for it was old-fashioned and sweet and mellow,
without being great music. She smiled a
little over it. She knew that Judge Jessup, who
liked good music, would call it “a finger-and-thumb
exercise.”</p>

<p>She was still playing it when it seemed to her
that her bit of sunshine had grown dim, or was
being obscured by some shadow, and she looked
up. William Carter was standing beside her. The
wide front doors were open in the warm summer
day. He had entered unheralded, and he was
standing there quietly, looking down at Virginia,
mute as a graven image, and nearly as pale.</p>

<p>She was taken unawares, terribly unawares, and
her slender fingers made a little discord before
they fell from the keys. She turned a startled
face toward him, paling and then flushing, her
lips tremulous.</p>

<p>“William!” she exclaimed softly, almost below
her breath. “How you startled me!”</p>

<p>“I’ve no right to be here,” he exclaimed bitterly.
“I’ve felt that ever since I crossed the
threshold and saw you sitting here—as you used
to sit here with me, Virginia.”</p>

<p>Her lips were still trembling, but she was recovering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
from the surprise. She rose from the
piano and went to a more distant chair, which
stood a little in the shadow. She did not want him
to see her face too plainly.</p>

<p>“Sit down, William,” she said pleasantly, suppressing
the quiver in her voice. “I’ve just heard
the news over the ’phone. I’m so happy about
Leigh!”</p>

<p>He did not sit down. He began, instead, to
march up and down the room, his hands behind
him and his head bowed gloomily.</p>

<p>“I’m glad about Leigh, too,” he replied grimly.
“He’s my brother—and I ought to have been in
his place! I’m glad, but——”</p>

<p>He broke off, and continued his pacing. Virginia
was startled again, this time painfully. Her
heart sank; she began to dread what he might say
next. She saw that he was almost beside himself.
Old memories rushed back, too—old, touching,
tender, and intimate things. This was the man
she had once promised to marry, the man who
had professed to love her so much. It seemed to
her that she had a moment of clairvoyance. She
knew the thoughts that must be thronging into his
mind, too. She was human, she was aware that
he had repented, that he had had bitter cause to
repent; but she tried not to think of that.</p>

<p>At last he stopped short and stood looking at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
her, his face as deeply flushed as it had been pale.
She made an effort to speak, but it seemed impossible,
and she averted her eyes. It was true,
she knew now that it was true—Fanchon had deceived
him. The whole miserable tragedy that had
crossed her own life, as well as his, was laid bare
before her. She could not look at him; she felt
a tightening in her throat.</p>

<p>“Listen”—he was still standing in front of her,
a grim figure of anger and despair—“I want to
tell you the truth. I must tell you, Virginia——”</p>

<p>She stopped him with an involuntary gesture of
protest.</p>

<p>“Oh, William, how can you?” she cried softly,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>She had lifted her clear eyes to his, unshadowed
and beautiful. He flinched from the look, and suddenly
he was dumb. He turned with a poignant
gesture of pain, averting his face.</p>

<p>Virginia rose from her chair and walked to the
window. She was no longer flushed; she was very
pale. Her breath was coming short, but her eyes
were clear and luminous as she looked out on the
old familiar garden, with its box-bordered flower-beds
and the wicker table under the old horse-chestnut.
She could almost see the tall, white head
of her grandfather.</p>

<p>She thought, at the moment, that she saw more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
than that. There was also a vision of her father—a
good man, too, and her mother. They had been
noble-minded—as noble-minded as her grandfather
was to-day. In his simple, kindly old-fashioned
way, Colonel Denbigh was a gentleman, and
Virginia knew it.</p>

<p>She clung to the window-sill, her hands trembling.
She had a woman’s heart, she was very
human—William had come back! How some
women would have triumphed in a rival’s misfortune!</p>

<p>Then she heard his voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve done wrong—everything has been tragic
and terrible. It’s almost too much to ask, but—Virginia,
can you forgive me?”</p>

<p>For a moment Virginia could not speak. She
did not even look at him. She was looking far
across the lawn toward the white road that led to
the town; but she saw nothing. Her eyes misted.
The break in his voice touched her; it hurt her to
hear it. She pitied him, yet there was a change
in her. She had not known it until this moment,
but now she knew it. It was as if she had seen
through a glass darkly, and now the veil was withdrawn,
and she looked into a clear mirror and beheld
her own image as it really was. Nothing
could ever be the same again, nothing could be as
it had been before, because her eyes were open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>“Did you hear me, Virginia!” he said hoarsely.
“Will you forgive me?”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes reluctantly to his again,
turning from white to red, but her lips no longer
trembled.</p>

<p>“I forgive you, William,” she replied gently,
and she held out her hand.</p>

<p>He took it and held it a moment while he
searched her eyes. Then he turned and made his
way blindly out of the room and out of the house.</p>

<p>He walked heavily down the driveway to the old
gates. An impulse had brought him—an impulse
that he had been too broken to resist. Now, in its
reaction, he despised his own weakness. What
right had he to worry Virginia? But his mind was
still in conflict; he could no longer think concisely
or even clearly. Like a man in a dream he walked
out of the gates and turned into the road toward
town.</p>

<p>The look in Virginia’s eyes, the look that had
roused him, came back to him only dimly. It was
obscured by the scene that haunted him—the scene
in the court-room. He could see the crowd of
staring faces again, the judge on the bench, judicial
and disinterested, the flushed, scowling countenance
of the prosecuting attorney, the jury—and
Daniel! How coolly his brother had stood in
that heated, tense atmosphere! How his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
had kindled and his voice pleaded for the boy’s
life! For jail would have been a living death to
one so young.</p>

<p>Leigh rose before him, too. He could see the
boy’s beautiful face and his girlish eyes, and the
change in him, the terrible change. The look of a
man—a man who has killed—was in those young
eyes!</p>

<p>William drew his breath hard. Her work, he
thought bitterly! And yet how she haunted him!
He could see more plainly than anything else her
small, white face with its pointed chin and its
fawn-like eyes. He could hear her voice, sweet and
hurrying and light, with the spell of sex in it—how
it haunted him, too! But he was done with
her. He set his teeth hard and clenched his hand,
walking on.</p>

<p>He walked blindly. A taxi passed, but he was
unaware of it. He never looked up, he looked
down into the dust of the road, for his heart was
heavy and bitter. He was done with her!</p>

<p>Fanchon, who had hidden in the corner of the
taxi that he might not see her, leaned forward
now and looked out. She was on her way to the
refuge she had found in the country—a poor, desolate
place, but all that she could pay for—more
than she could pay for, if the truth be told. She
felt ill and weak, and she must go somewhere—anywhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> 
away from the Carters. There was
fever in her blood and her lips were dry, but her
brilliant, restless eyes looked out after the figure
in the road.</p>

<p>She had seen him come out of the Denbigh
gates!</p>

<p>She had thought of this, she had pictured it. If
he got a divorce, he would marry Virginia—she
never doubted that Virginia would take him. And
now, now when it seemed to her that it was already
on its way to accomplishment, she sank
back into her corner aghast.</p>

<p>She lifted a shaking hand and pushed back the
soft hair from her forehead. It was a helpless,
thoughtless gesture, but she had pulled off her
gloves, and the light caught the rings on her fingers.
Suddenly she saw her wedding-ring—William’s
ring. She held out her small hand and
stared at it, choking back the sob in her throat.
She remembered the look in his eyes when he had
put that ring on her finger. How he had loved
her then!</p>

<p>A passion of tears and rage swept over her, and
she cowered back in the taxi, weeping and beating
the air with her small hands clenched. They had
taken him away from her, they had made him hate
her, and this girl—this girl with the superior look
and the calm, sweet face—she would have him!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
That was the bitterest drop in Fanchon’s cup of
gall. It was that which set her to shaking and
choking with rage and grief. William had passed
her, he had not even looked at her. He had been
to see Virginia!</p>

<p>Fanchon stared at the ring on her finger. It
seemed to fascinate her.</p>

<p>Then she became aware of the laboring sound
of the taxi. They were traveling along a rough
road. Here it was ascending, and the motor-engine
puffed and bellowed, and wheezed like a
whale in a trough of the sea. She leaned forward
and looked out again. The road led through a
wood. She could discern the slender stems of
young trees in ever increasing ranks. Ahead of
them a stream ran down to a bridge.</p>

<p>The sight of the water dashing over the stones
brought a new purpose to mind. She called to the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Stop! I want to get out here.”</p>

<p>He slowed down and stopped the machine, looking
surprised. Fanchon opened the door and
sprang lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said quickly, authoritatively. “I’ll
be back in a minute.”</p>

<p>The man stared, but he waited obediently. He
had an idea that the lady was a little eccentric;
but she was a beauty, and she was famous. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
had been delighted to drive off with her in his cab.
He leaned out now and watched her surreptitiously;
but she had turned into the brush, and
he lost sight of her small figure. She was so
small that she was easily lost in the low growth
of sumac.</p>

<p>Fanchon knew that he was watching her. She
checked an impulse to go straight down to the
brook in plain sight of the road. She turned, instead,
and followed a path that led her to a still
pool. The water was clear, and she could see the
pebbles in the sandy bottom. It was scarcely a
foot deep, but the place was hidden, and it would
serve her purpose well.</p>

<p>She stepped out on a stone at the edge of the
pool, and stood a moment staring down into it,
panting a little, her lips moving. Her small,
black-clad figure, her white face, and her wild,
beautiful eyes had a startling effect. There was
something sylvan about her, and the sylvan landscape
framed her well; but she had, too, the look
of a sorceress weaving a spell.</p>

<p>Slowly, deliberately, as if she performed a rite,
she drew the wedding-ring off her finger, held it
aloft a moment, and then, with a gesture more
eloquent than words, she flung it into the pool.</p>

<p>“<i>C’est fini!</i>” she cried, choking and sobbing.</p>

<p>It sank to the bottom, but it was not hidden. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
lay there sideways, glittering. A fugitive ray of
sunlight, striking the surface of the still water,
found it and made merry with it. It sent a glint
out of the gold like a flash of laughter in a dark
place; it danced upon it and rippled over it—and
then a tadpole disturbed the pool.</p>

<p>Fanchon, still shaking, still filled with jealousy
and misery, stared at the ring. It seemed to her
that it mocked her, that it called her an outcast,
that it laughed her to scorn. Her wedding-ring,
the tangible sign of the link that bound her to
William—how it flashed and glittered! Not even
water hid it.</p>

<p>Her lips twitched painfully, not with mirth but
with anguish, and she covered her eyes with her
hands. Shutting the sight of it out thus, she
stumbled back to the path.</p>

<p>She had scarcely tasted food that day, and she
felt suddenly faint and dizzy; but she set her small
white teeth on her lip, and her great eyes smoldered
dangerously. She was wildly angry again
now. She ran along the path and had almost
reached the end of it when she wavered, then stopped
short and stared at her hands.</p>

<p>That third finger felt unnatural. It seemed to
grin at her—white and bare as a bone. She felt
for her gloves, and could not find them. She leaned
against a tree and clasped her finger with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
small, bare hands. In her agony of mind she
clutched and tore at the bark until the blood came.
The cut in the flesh roused her; she drew a deep
breath and looked back.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she murmured softly, and then:
“<i>Non, non</i>, I cannot—I cannot!”</p>

<p>So she went back slowly, reluctantly, as if she
was drawn against her will. She went all the way
to the edge of the pool and looked into it. Yes, it
was there—her ring! How it gleamed at her! So
might the eye of the serpent have gleamed in triumph
at Eve in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>She couldn’t resist it. She stooped and picked
up a stick. Creeping out on the stone again,
she tried to fish up her ring with the stick; but it
went deeper; it seemed to wink at her and dodge
her, burrowing into the sand. With a cry of anguish,
Fanchon dropped to her knees, half in the
water, and plunged her arm into the pool, digging
into the sand with her fingers. Joy and relief shot
through her heart when she felt the hard metal
loop again. She had it!</p>

<p>She staggered to her feet, holding it tight, but
she wouldn’t put it back on her finger. She knotted
it into her wet handkerchief and thrust it into
her bosom. Then, blindly, weeping and shaken
and dripping, she made her way back to the waiting
taxi.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Denbigh</span> was pleasantly detained at
the club luncheon. He went home in a taxi late in
the afternoon, only about half an hour before his
own dinner-time. Plato met him in the hall.</p>

<p>“Miss Jinny ain’t eaten no lunch, no suh, an’
now she’s up in her room. She say she’s got headache,
an’ not to wait dinner.”</p>

<p>The colonel deposited his broad-brimmed hat
on the table.</p>

<p>“Anybody been here to see me to-day, Plato?”</p>

<p>The old negro shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, suh. Mist’ Wilyum Carter, he came in
to see Miss Jinny, but he’s gone ’bout two hours
ago.”</p>

<p>A strange expression flitted across the colonel’s
face, but he did not show it to his faithful factotum.</p>

<p>“Serve dinner on time, Plato,” he said gravely.
“I don’t expect company—lunched in town with
Judge Jessup and Mr. Payson.”</p>

<p>“Yessuh, so Miss Jinny tole me. Great trial,
suh! Mirandy, Miz Carter’s collud girl, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
’phoned me ’bout it. She say she got so excited
she went out in de yard an’ killed the wrong hen
fo’ dinner. She killed de bes’ layer dey got, an’
Mist’ Carter he mos’ throw a fit. She say he’s
gwine to make Mist’ Wilyum git a divorcement——”</p>

<p>“Plato,” bellowed the colonel, “how often have
I got to tell you to stop gossiping? You quit it
and get my dinner ready, or I’ll kill you instead of
Mrs. Carter’s hen! Hear me?”</p>

<p>Plato giggled disgracefully, but he retired toward
the dining-room door.</p>

<p>“Colonel Colfax he used to say——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” shouted Colonel Denbigh, making
for the stairs.</p>

<p>Plato withdrew slowly, still mumbling, and the
colonel went up to Virginia’s room. He hesitated
an instant, and then he knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Got a bad headache, Jinny?”</p>

<p>She answered without opening the door.</p>

<p>“Very bad, grandpa. Don’t wait dinner—I
don’t want any.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ’phone for Dr. Barbour,” he suggested
anxiously. “How about it, Jinny?”</p>

<p>“No, no! It’s just a little headache from the
sun. Any news, grandpa?”</p>

<p>The colonel, outside the closed door, stood with
his hand at his chin, thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>“Not much, Jinny. I ’phoned everything I
could, didn’t I? Dan made a great figure at the
trial, and Leigh’s home now—I reckon Mrs.
Carter’s got him packed in cotton-batting by this
time. There’s one thing—I saw myself——” He
hesitated, listening, but there was no interrogation
from the other side of the door. “I saw William
Carter ignore his wife in open court—after the
verdict. It—well, Jinny, it stuck in my throat.”</p>

<p>There was a significant silence. He heard the
slight stir of some one in the room; he thought
that Virginia had been lying down and had suddenly
sat up.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was just right,” she said at
last, in a faint voice. “He was here this afternoon,
and he told me—he says she’s left him for
good.”</p>

<p>The colonel, outside the door, gritted his teeth
a moment in silence, very red in the face.</p>

<p>“The lummox!” he muttered under his breath
at last.</p>

<p>“What did you say, grandpa?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything, Jinny. I only thought
something. I thought something not quite polite.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Again he heard the faint stir of her movements
on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>“The girl looked like death,” he said bluntly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
“She’d been through a terrible ordeal. It—I tell
you what, Jinny, it looked darned cowardly!”</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, not even the rustle
of Virginia’s garments. The colonel waited, rubbing
his chin. At last he thought it better to leave
something to her imagination.</p>

<p>“Have a bottle of ginger ale, Jinny? It’ll do
your head good.”</p>

<p>She laughed hysterically. He could hear it. It
was a musical laugh, but it was full of tears. His
hand clenched.</p>

<p>“You get better!” he called to her. “I want
you to drive up the mountain to-morrow and look
at Colonel Russell’s mare. He wants to sell her
for a lady’s saddle-horse. I reckon you’d like
her, Jinny. It’ll take you about half the day.
You can lunch with Mrs. Barbour. The doctor
met me in town to-day, and he said his wife
wanted you out to luncheon at the farm to-morrow.”</p>

<p>There was a rustle this time.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go. Thank you, grandpa. You’re
an angel—I mean about the horse.”</p>

<p>The old man cackled.</p>

<p>“Not in any other way, eh, Jinny?”</p>

<p>“You go to your dinner! You’ll get no compliments
here,” she called back gaily.</p>

<p>But it was a tremulous gaiety. The old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
knew it, and he suspected the headache. He went
slowly and thoughtfully down-stairs. Dinner was
already served in the quaint dining-room, Plato
standing erect and black as ebony behind the
colonel’s chair. The old man glanced contentedly
at the white damask and the old-fashioned service.</p>

<p>“What have you got for dinner, Plato?” he
asked as he sat down.</p>

<p>Plato went over a modest menu.</p>

<p>“Got some deviled crabs, col’nel. Yessuh, got
’em dis mornin’ when yo’ was in court—bigges’
crabs I’s seen dis season.”</p>

<p>The colonel considered.</p>

<p>“Plato, you take a deviled crab up to Miss
Jinny’s room. If she doesn’t eat it, I’ll ’phone
for Dr. Barbour.”</p>

<p>Unconsciously, the colonel was applying Miranda’s
panacea for all human ills. Inwardly he
was exceeding wroth with William Carter. His
wrath and his fears continued well into the next
morning, until he saw Virginia, pale but smiling,
seated in the old wagonette, and Lucas driving sedately
down the roadway to the gate. The colonel
observed their departure with an anxious eye.</p>

<p>He was not sure now that Virginia cared. She
was pale, but she was holding her own. The idea
that William Carter had dared to come straight
back—after that trial and all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“The lummox!” the colonel growled under his
breath. “The cowardly lummox—he knew I was
out.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lucas was driving slowly along the
turnpike down which Fanchon had galloped, followed
by Corwin—on his way, as it turned out, to
his death; for that ride had led straight to the
climax in the upper room of the inn. As it transpired
later on, both Virginia and Lucas were
thinking of it as the colonel’s slow old horses trotted
along under the spreading branches of the
great trees which stood like sentinels on either side
of the wide road.</p>

<p>At this late season the foliage was dense and a
little dusty, while here and there a sumac waved
the first red flag of autumn, or a gum-tree stood
like a flame in the midst of a grove of cedars. Virginia
was watching a cardinal-bird winging its
crimson flight from branch to branch when she
heard Lucas accost a passing friend and then fall
to chuckling—the succulent, suggestively happy
chuckle of the negro. Lucas had never acquired
the silent elegance of Mrs. Payson’s coachman.
He was an old family servant, and he had known
Virginia from her childhood. He chuckled now,
touching the off horse with the mildly provoking
tip of his whip.</p>

<p>“See dat nigger, Miss Jinny? He works at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
Miz Quantah’s place. He’s gwine courtin’, sho’s
yo’re born!”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had lost sight of the red bird,
glanced down the road after the retreating form
of a middle-aged negro attired in clean blue overalls
and a big straw hat.</p>

<p>“How do you know he’s going courting, Lucas?
He’s not very young, is he?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, Miss Jinny, he ain’t, but his wife
died a while ago. He’s gwine courtin’—yes, miss,
he sho’ is. How’d I know? He done wash his
face, Miss Jinny. When a man wash his face an’
shave, he’s gwine courtin’—yes, miss.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed, and Lucas, thus encouraged,
proceeded. He touched the nigh horse this time.</p>

<p>“Yo’ g’long, Tommy Becket. Yes, Miss Jinny,
he’s gwine courtin’—he works ober at Miz Quantah’s,
ayonnah”—Lucas pointed his whip—“righ’
over dere in dem trees. Dat’s where Miz Wilyum
Carter am now, Miss Jinny.”</p>

<p>Virginia blushed. Involuntarily her eyes followed
the flourish of his whip. They had come to
the foot-hills, and, in a clearing, she saw a bleak
farmhouse, a mere shack it seemed to her. She
remembered that the Quantah place was miserable
and the woman herself gaunt and poor—a forlorn,
forbidding creature.</p>

<p>Then Lucas broke into his monologue again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>“Miz Carter, she’s sick, Miss Jinny—took sick
jest after de trial. I did heah she ain’t got any
money, an’ Miz Quantah, she’s gwine to turn her
out, sick or no sick, she say.”</p>

<p>Virginia sat up suddenly.</p>

<p>“What did you say, Lucas?”</p>

<p>Lucas turned half-way round, driving with one
hand, and flourishing the other as he answered.</p>

<p>“I say Miz Wilyum Carter took sick, an’ she
ain’t got any money.” Lucas stopped the horses
and pointed.</p>

<p>“I reckon she’s sick in dat room ayonnah—see
de blinds open? Ain’t nebber open ’less Miz
Quantah got a lodger. Ain’t got noffin to eat at
Miz Quantah’s ’cept corn-dodgers an’ rabbits—no,
Miss Jinny, dey ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Lucas,” said Virginia earnestly, “do you
really mean that Mrs. William Carter is over there
now, ill, and without money?”</p>

<p>“Sho, Miss Jinny, she is. I got dat from Miz
Quantah’s collud man—yes, miss, I sho did. She’s
sick an’ she ain’t got no money.”</p>

<p>Virginia was silent. Her eyes fixed themselves
on that distant house, that repulsive, sordid-looking
house, and she thought of Fanchon—a small,
dainty, bewitching creature—dancing that amazing
dance at the church musicale.</p>

<p>Lucas started the horses. The road turned, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
before them a low bridge spanned an exquisite
stream. The water purled and dashed over stones
and slipped, still clamoring, into a lovely pool
where lily-pads floated and low willows dipped
their swinging boughs.</p>

<p>“Lucas, stop!” cried Virginia.</p>

<p>Lucas pulled the horses up so suddenly that
one old fellow looked back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Jinny?”</p>

<p>“Drive back to Quantah’s place, Lucas.”</p>

<p>The fat old horses turned obediently. Lucas
said nothing. For once he restrained that racial
quality which makes the faithful colored servant
the intimate adviser and guardian of “his family.”
He had a very clear understanding of Miss
Jinny’s motives, he knew Miss Jinny. For all
that, he felt that this time she could be trusted to
go her own way—as long as he was in attendance,
to exercise, at the crucial moment, his worldly
wisdom.</p>

<p>The old wagonette, turning clumsily because of
its length, was moving along the broken bit of road
which led around the elbow of the wood into the
Quantah clearing. The wood was an exquisite
place, delicately fringed along its edges with yellow
patches of goldenrod and the purplish white
mist of asters. Through slender tree-stems Virginia
began to see the house more plainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>The side door stood open, and a tall, slatternly
woman was feeding chickens, holding an old tin
saucepan in the hollow of her arm. As the
wagonette appeared she raised her eyes from the
fowls long enough to stare, but went on throwing
scraps out by the fistful, her hard mouth drawn
into forbidding lines.</p>

<p>Lucas drew rein and Virginia descended.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. William Carter here?” she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Quantah emptied the pan and looked
around her.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is—she’s sick, too.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s quick blush mounted. She felt peculiarly
helpless. She was not even sure that Fanchon
would see her, but she held out her card.</p>

<p>“Please ask her to see me—if she can,” she
said, in a propitiating tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Quantah wiped her fingers on her apron
and took the card.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said harshly, holding open the
door.</p>

<p>Virginia followed her in. Involuntarily she
gathered her white dress about her, the place
seemed so dingy and repulsive. They passed
through a forlorn hall and entered the kitchen.
Sitting in a chair in the middle of the old room,
with his back to the stove, was Mr. Samuel Bernstein.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
Virginia stopped involuntarily, and the
woman, pulling out a chair for her, left them
abruptly, carrying Virginia’s card in the empty
saucepan.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein rose and bowed.</p>

<p>“Miss Denbigh, I think?” he said with elaborate
politeness.</p>

<p>Virginia smiled.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bernstein, I know,” she replied quietly.</p>

<p>He offered his chair.</p>

<p>“It’s better than the one she’s given you,” he
said graciously, “which ain’t sayin’ much. Sit
down, Miss Denbigh. I guess you’ve come out
here same as I have. I’m trying to see Mrs.
Carter—Miss Fanchon la Fare, I guess it is now.
This party”—he waved his thumb over his shoulder—“Mrs.
Quantah, she says Mrs. Carter’s
sick.”</p>

<p>“So I hear.” Virginia turned her eyes discreetly
away. She could not look at Mr. Bernstein
without thinking of his effort to engage her grandfather,
and she wanted to laugh in spite of her
errand. “I’m very sorry; I hope she’ll see me.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.” Mr. Bernstein leaned forward
confidentially. “Say, I’ll tell you what I’ve done.
You see, I felt kinder guilty. You know about that
Carter boy? Well, I came out here on purpose to
make good. I’m offering Miss Fanchon one thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
dollars a week for one big seven-reel feature
for the Unlimited Film Company, and, after that,
say, five hundred a week steady as ingenoo in the
company.”</p>

<p>Virginia lifted her eyes with difficulty to the
kindly red face opposite.</p>

<p>“That seems magnificent, Mr. Bernstein,” she
said softly, and then in spite of herself she giggled.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein beamed.</p>

<p>“It’s a good offer, if I do say it! But, see here,
Miss Denbigh, it ain’t often we get a subject like
that. She’s just ideal for dances—see? Now,
there’s another thing—coming out here, I made
a find!” Mr. Bernstein raised one fat hand and
spoke behind it, watching the door. “Notice that
party—Mrs. Quantah?”</p>

<p>Virginia nodded, her eyes dancing. Mr. Bernstein
edged his chair closer.</p>

<p>“Say! We’re going to do some Dickens pictures.
No copyright on Dickens, you know, an’
it’s easy to get ’em. We’re going to do ‘Nicholas
Nickleby.’ Now I ask you, did you ever see a better
<i>Miss Squeers</i>? Look at her—take her all
around—them angles an’ that mouth! Say, I’d
give her something neat, believe me I would. I
said so to her, an’ what d’you suppose she said
to me? That woman, poor as Job’s turkey—what
d’you suppose she said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>Virginia was unable to imagine it and said so—with
some difficulty, her lips tremulous.</p>

<p>“I asked her.” Mr. Bernstein leaned back in
his chair and shook his head sadly. “I told her
what I wanted an’ what I’d pay, an’ she said,
‘Nothing doin’!’ Now, what d’you know about
that?”</p>

<p>He was about to say more, to enlarge on his
grievance and on Mrs. Quantah’s resemblance to
<i>Miss Squeers</i>, but there was a sharp sound. A
door opened and shut, and the ideal <i>Miss Squeers</i>
entered. She did not look at Mr. Bernstein, but
turned a stony gaze upon Virginia’s flushed and
smiling face.</p>

<p>“She’ll see you,” she said laconically.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein leaned farther back in his chair
with the air of a martyr determined to await his
turn, if it took all night. Virginia rose hastily
and followed Mrs. Quantah.</p>

<p>A moment before she had had to laugh at Bernstein;
now her heart sank. She felt that Fanchon
had never liked her, and now—wasn’t this an intrusion?
Her courage suddenly wavered, and her
knees felt weak under her when the gaunt woman
opened a door at the end of the hall and almost
thrust her into the room beyond.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> room was small and dim, although the shutters
were open, as Lucas had remarked. There
was a frayed and scanty look to everything, but a
big four-poster stood in the corner. Lying across
that, looking as small and helpless as a child, was
Fanchon. She was half dressed, and she lay with
her head on her arm, her soft dark hair tumbled
about her shoulders and framing her white profile.</p>

<p>Virginia, who had stopped just inside the door,
stood waiting, hesitating, uncertain what to do.
Fanchon did not move, and she looked so white
and limp as she lay there that Virginia thought
she had fainted. She went quickly across the room
and stood beside the bed, looking down at the
motionless figure.</p>

<p>Fanchon’s eyes were closed, and the long, thick
lashes made shadows on her white cheeks. There
was no sign of makeup now except a touch of the
lips that made her mouth look scarlet, in fearful
contrast to the whiteness of cheeks and brow and
throat. One arm was thrown across the bed and
the small hand clasped the crumpled coverlet
convulsively, the blue veins showing through its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
delicate whiteness. Half-clad as she was, Virginia
saw how thin were Fanchon’s arms and how slender
her neck, delicate and round as the stem of a
flower. How changed she was!</p>

<p>A memory of the daring little figure in white
flashed back, and a flood of pity submerged Virginia’s
heart. William’s cry, “I’m done with
her!”—how incredibly cruel it would have seemed
here!</p>

<p>Still she did not move or speak, and Virginia
touched her gently.</p>

<p>“Fanchon!” she said softly.</p>

<p>Very slowly Fanchon rose on her elbow and
looked at the visitor. The fawn-like eyes were no
longer soft; there was a smoldering fire in them,
and the delicate brows came down above them.
The small white face was distorted with an emotion
that seemed to shake her from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Why do you come here?” she asked sharply.
“What do you want of me?”</p>

<p>Virginia’s blush deepened painfully.</p>

<p>“I came because I heard you were ill and in
trouble,” she replied kindly, her voice trembling
a little.</p>

<p>Fanchon drew herself up farther into a sitting
attitude, her knees under her chin and her hands
clasping them. Her eyes still lowered at Virginia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
and the whiteness of her face against her
loose, dark hair had an almost weird effect.</p>

<p>“Why do you care for that?” she asked slowly.
“Why do you want to see how far I’m down?”</p>

<p>Her tone and her glance alike conveyed almost
an insult, and certainly a defiance; yet she was so
weak that the other girl saw her tremble from
head to foot, as if she had an ague. Again Virginia
blushed, but this time she raised her head
proudly.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me,” she replied gravely.
“You wouldn’t say that to me if you did. I’m—I’m
not like that.”</p>

<p>Fanchon still looked at her steadily, an untamed
passion leaping up in her brown eyes like a
flame.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, I know you well enough, I think!” she
retorted bitterly. “You’re the woman my husband
loved—and you’ve taken him from me! Oh,
I know—you can look indignant! You righteous
people—oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, how good you are! But
you’ve taken him away, for all that.”</p>

<p>Virginia, who had never had such things said
to her before, recoiled. She drew away, looking
at the wild little creature on the bed with a kind
of horror. For a moment all her impulses were
beaten down, and in the rebound she was ready to
turn her back, to abandon the wretched girl to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
fate. She felt as if physical blows had been rained
upon her, as if she was no longer the Virginia
Denbigh who had entered that wretched room on
an errand of mercy.</p>

<p>“If you say things like that I can’t stay to hear
them,” she said hurriedly, speaking with an effort,
hot tears in her eyes. “I came to help you, if I
could—and you insult me.”</p>

<p>Fanchon laughed the shrill laughter of hysterics.</p>

<p>“You don’t like it!” she cried wildly. “<i>Que
voulez vous?</i> You want only nice things said to
you—and I can have all the horrid things and all
the insults. That’s all I’ve had since I came
here!”</p>

<p>Virginia, who was half-way to the door, stood
still. Her quick ear had caught the wildness of
the laughter, and the poor little huddled figure
was sinking weakly forward. She came back.</p>

<p>“Fanchon, I came to help you. I’m telling you
the truth—can’t you believe me? I should like to
help you, if I could.”</p>

<p>Fanchon’s face twisted convulsively, and she
snatched at the coverlet and drew it up over her
shoulders. To Virginia she looked like a wild
child playing at “tents” under the counterpane.</p>

<p>“<i>Tiens!</i>” she cried fretfully. “I don’t know
what you mean. I’ve always told stories myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
until—until Leigh killed that man. Now, I’m not
telling stories. I suppose I can believe that you
meant to do something—something queer. That’s
what they’ve all done to me since I came. I
don’t know why you’re here—I don’t care! <i>C’est
fini</i>—I’m done with you all!”</p>

<p>Virginia started. She remembered William’s
words.</p>

<p>“I came because you’re ill. I want to help you,
to make you more comfortable. That’s really all I
came for, Fanchon. I’m sorry you feel so toward
us—toward me.”</p>

<p>Fanchon shook back her hair and looked at the
other girl curiously, her eyes darkening and
changing wonderfully.</p>

<p>“How pretty she is,” Virginia thought, “and
how wretched.”</p>

<p>But Fanchon did not speak. For a while she
only studied Virginia. At last she spoke slowly,
twisting the coverlet.</p>

<p>“Were you in court?” she asked.</p>

<p>Virginia shook her head. Fanchon’s eyes held
hers, with that fierce, dark, challenging look.</p>

<p>“But you know my story?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard it,” Virginia reluctantly answered.</p>

<p>“My husband told you!” Fanchon sprang out
of bed and ran across the room, seizing Virginia’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
arm and looking at her wildly. “William told
you!”</p>

<p>Virginia, who was fatally honest sometimes, said
nothing; but her face confessed that William had
told her much. She was horrified. How could
she make this furious little creature understand
how William had told her, and how she had replied?
She ought never to have come here.</p>

<p>For an instant panic seized her and she longed
to get away; and then her inherited and noble
fearlessness steadied her. She met Fanchon’s
feverish look calmly and frankly.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d believe me,” she said simply.
“I’m not that sort of a woman, Fanchon. It’s
true that William and I were engaged once, but
he broke it off when he married you. And now”—Virginia’s
pride flashed in her eyes—“if he
were free to-morrow, Fanchon, it would make no
difference—no difference in the world to me.”</p>

<p>They looked at each other. Fanchon, still holding
the other girl’s arm in her shaking hands,
searched Virginia’s face with that wild look of
hers, her lips quivering. Virginia met the look
at first proudly and angrily, and then with such
compassion, such tenderness and honesty, that
Fanchon’s lips twisted convulsively again. Suddenly
she dropped Virginia’s arm and turned
away. She took an unsteady step and almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
reeled as she flung herself into a chair, hiding
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Do you believe me now, Fanchon?” Virginia
asked, more gently.</p>

<p>There was no answer for a moment, then she
heard the other girl’s convulsive weeping. Fanchon,
who had never controlled an impulse in her
life, was weeping wildly, twisting about in her
chair and beating the air for breath. It startled
Virginia; she forgot herself and went to her.
Seizing the frantic little hands, she held them in
her cool, firm ones, as a mother might hold a frantic
child’s.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she whispered. “You’re ill, you
mustn’t! Don’t cry like this.”</p>

<p>But Fanchon wept on until she lay there almost
fainting, white and limp and broken. Virginia
began to suspect what had happened before
she came into the room.</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu</i>, they all hated me!” Fanchon gasped at
last. “All but Leigh and that silly child, Emily.”
She laughed wildly, still gasping. “She tried to
paint her face like mine, and they made her wash
it off. <i>Quelle drôle de chose que la vie!</i> And they
hated me for that.” She gasped again, dragging
her hands away from Virginia and beating the
air with them. “They made him hate me, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>“Oh, no, no!” cried Virginia. “Fanchon,
you’re wild—you don’t understand!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand!” she retorted bitterly.
“You’re one of them. I don’t know why you
came here—you’re one of them!”</p>

<p>“I came because you’re ill. You’ll be very ill
if you don’t stop.”</p>

<p>“You think I’ll die, <i>n’est-ce-pas</i>?” Her red
mouth twisted oddly. “They’d like me to die, so
he’d be free. They’re so good—they don’t like
divorces!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Virginia steadily. “I wouldn’t
stay here if you were not so ill, Fanchon, you’re
trembling and shaking. Let me get a doctor for
you; let me take you out of this wretched place.”</p>

<p>Fanchon laughed again hysterically.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine place, isn’t it? <i>Tiens!</i> The place
for Mrs. William Carter. You see I have no
money. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, I wouldn’t take a cent of his—I’d
starve first!”</p>

<p>“I understand.” Virginia laid her hand gently
on her shoulder. “I should feel like that myself.
But I’m a woman, Fanchon—let me help you while
you’re so ill.”</p>

<p>Something in her touch, her voice, reached the
girl. She stopped shivering and looked up into
Virginia’s face. She looked up steadily, her own
face changing and quivering. Then, suddenly, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
sank back in her chair very pale and quiet, her
large eyes fixed not on Virginia now, but on space.</p>

<p>“He was the only good man who ever loved
me,” she said in a low voice. “I’m not bad—I’ve
never been bad—but they thought I was, and
I lied to him. I was afraid that if he knew I was
divorced he wouldn’t care for me—not in that way—and
it would have killed me then.” Her voice
broke pitifully. “I—I loved him.”</p>

<p>Her head sank mournfully, she began to tear at
the elaborate lace petticoat she wore.</p>

<p>“You mean William?” said Virginia gently.</p>

<p>She nodded. Then, with a convulsive effort,
she went on, more to herself than to Virginia.</p>

<p>“He was good, and he loved me. He asked me
to marry him, and I lied. I said I’d never been
married before. I needn’t have said it, but I was
afraid. I lied. And he hates me.” Her voice
wavered again. “He hates me. I shall never see
him again!”</p>

<p>“But you love him still, Fanchon,” Virginia
said softly; “and if you love him you’ll forgive
him.”</p>

<p>Fanchon’s face flamed suddenly.</p>

<p>“Never! I don’t want to see him again.” She
rose unsteadily. “I’m going to dress and go out
there.” She pointed toward the door, laughing
again and trembling at the same time. “That fat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
man is out there. I’m going into his pictures.
He’s not afraid to engage me for his show.”</p>

<p>“You can’t go, Fanchon,” said Virginia quickly.
“You’re too ill. I must help you.” She
stopped, and her eyes filled with tears. “Fanchon,
I’m so sorry for you, I hope you understand.
Let me help you.”</p>

<p>Fanchon turned, caught at a chair-back, and
clung to it, laughing wildly.</p>

<p>“You’re so sorry for me—and he loves you!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Virginia, “he shan’t! If he did,
it would make no difference. Fanchon, I want
you to leave this place and come with me. Let me
take care of you. You’re too ill to stand up.”</p>

<p>“To stand up? Why, I’m going to dance for
the pictures. You call me ill? I can dance. <i>Attendez!</i>”</p>

<p>She let go of the chair to which she had been
clinging, and seemed to listen, her head bent and
her brown eyes brilliant, her whole small figure
quivering and tense.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu</i>—I hear it—the music!”</p>

<p>She swayed slightly, and then softly, easily, she
began to dance. She danced wonderfully, keeping
time to the music that she seemed to hear, swaying
with it, stepping back and forth, weaving a
dance so strange, so weird, so silent, that Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
could not move. She stood rooted to the spot,
watching, fascinated—watching the white face and
the wild hair, the half-bare shoulders and the
slender lifted arms.</p>

<p>Fanchon clasped her hands behind her head,
twisting her slender body this way and that. Her
small bare feet flashed back and forth, soft and
silent and incredibly swift. She danced across
the room, back and forth, to and fro, and Virginia
watched her. Never in her life had she seen
such dancing, never in her life had she seen such
a wretched, quivering, tear-stained face. She
thought it would have touched a heart of stone.</p>

<p>At last she could endure it no longer; it seemed
to her like the dance of death.</p>

<p>“Stop!” she cried. “Oh, Fanchon, stop!”</p>

<p>Virginia’s voice, the sharp sound of her own
name, broke the spell. Fanchon turned her head
and looked at her. Something seemed to snap in
her brain; her eyes clouded, she reeled, and,
stretching out groping hands, she staggered blindly
and would have fallen had not the other girl
caught her. Virginia held her by main force, almost
lifting her in her strong young arms, for
suddenly all the life and motion had left the small
wasted figure, and Fanchon lay white and senseless
against her breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>Ten minutes later Virginia came out of Fanchon’s
room and closed the door behind her. She
was very pale, but her eyes shone. She ignored
the patient Bernstein and spoke directly to the
woman.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Quantah, I’m going to take Mrs. Carter
home with me. Have you a telephone?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Quantah stood rigidly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no phone, an’ she ain’t a goin’ to
take her trunk until she pays. She owes me two
weeks’ board now, and extries.”</p>

<p>“I was just telling the lady,” Mr. Bernstein
began, “I’d pay in advance if—”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay,” said Virginia superbly, sweeping
past them, her head up. “Make out your bill in
full, Mrs. Quantah.”</p>

<p>She opened the hall door and called Lucas.</p>

<p>“Drive over for Dr. Barbour, Lucas. Bring him
here at once, if you can. While you’re over there,
phone to Plato to get the west room ready for
an invalid—yes, and phone to the colonel that I
want him out here—in a taxi.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, Miss Jinny.”</p>

<p>Lucas turned the fat horses around with their
heads toward the highroad. Then he looked back
at the tall white-clad figure in the door.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” she called after him.</p>

<p>Lucas whipped up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>“G’long, Billy! Ain’t dat jus’ Miss Jinny? I
knowed it, I knowed it—if she ain’t gwine t’ bring
Miz Wilyum Carter home! Ain’t dat Miss Jinny
cl’ar down to de groun’? I declare to goodness if
it don’ beat all.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> morning fell on the first day of September,
and it was very hot—so hot that Mr. Carter
refused to go to church. He was sitting in
the shade of his library, in his shirt-sleeves and
his stocking feet, when his wife and Emily returned
from service. Emily went up to her room
at once, but Mrs. Carter came into the library,
took off her hat, and sat down to get cool. She
was a little flushed and thoughtful.</p>

<p>“The Denbighs were not in church,” she remarked
after a moment. “I don’t know that I
ever knew Colonel Denbigh to miss a Sunday, except
when his son died. Do you remember, Johnson?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter nodded. He had stopped reading
the Sunday paper and was slowly fanning himself
with it.</p>

<p>“Sensible man to stay at home,” he grunted.</p>

<p>“People stare so at us!” Mrs. Carter complained.
“Emily and I felt like a circus. I’m so
glad we’ve got Leigh off to college at last!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made no reply to this, but after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
an interval he muttered something about a young
donkey. Mrs. Carter sighed.</p>

<p>“Where’s William?” she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, who had become nervous under continued
misfortune, started violently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Do you happen to think he’s
drowned himself?”</p>

<p>“Johnson!”</p>

<p>“I’m expecting anything,” said Mr. Carter
desperately. “There’s only one sensible person
in this family, and that’s Dan.”</p>

<p>“Dan’s out at the Denbighs’—I don’t know
what for. He’s been out there twice since Friday,
and he’s worried. I can see it.”</p>

<p>“Of course! He’s in love with that girl now, I
reckon, and she won’t have a cripple.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t a cripple!” cried his mother warmly.
“He’s only lame; but it’s not that; papa—I think
it’s something about—” She looked around a little
flushed and added, in a whisper, “about Fanchon.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter said something short and cryptic
and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel that it’s right,” his wife continued
bravely. “It’s worrying me, Johnson.
William hasn’t—well, he hasn’t shown any feeling
at all.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to get a divorce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>William’s mother sighed.</p>

<p>“I hate divorces,” she said at last. “We never
had one in the family.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re from South Carolina,”
retorted her husband unfeelingly. “Can’t get one
there, anyway.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter disregarded this.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel right about it. She—she saved
Leigh.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter pursed his lips, moving his feet comfortably
about on the rug. He and his wife had
been over this ground before, and it irked him.
He watched his toes moving inside of his coarse
white stockings. There was a silence.</p>

<p>The door-bell rang sharply. Mrs. Carter
jumped.</p>

<p>“Oh, Johnson, put on your coat and your
shoes,” she cried. “Miranda’s let some one in.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter began to jam his hot feet into his
shoes, which seemed incredibly too small to receive
them.</p>

<p>“Drat it!” he said.</p>

<p>He had not got to the coat when Miranda’s
amiable chocolate face appeared at the door.</p>

<p>“Col’nel Denbigh, Mist’ Carter,” she said, and
withdrew.</p>

<p>The colonel, carrying his wide hat in his hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
came in. He looked very tall, very thin, and very
grave.</p>

<p>“Oh, colonel, is there anything the matter?”
Mrs. Carter cried impulsively, seeing his face.</p>

<p>The colonel stood still, his white head erect and
his fine old face flushing a little.</p>

<p>“I came to see William,” he said. “Is he
here?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter ran to the door.</p>

<p>“Miranda,” she called after the girl, “go up
and tell Mr. William to come down.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Carter had offered a chair. He
was a little startled and perplexed, but he looked
keenly at the colonel.</p>

<p>“Do you want us to go, colonel?” he asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh lifted a protesting hand.</p>

<p>“No! I want you all to hear what I have to
say, especially William. It concerns William.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, who had returned to her seat,
looked frightened. There was an awkward pause,
the colonel sitting quietly in the high-backed chair,
looking into the crown of his hat.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s very hot,” ventured Mrs. Carter
faintly.</p>

<p>The colonel glanced kindly from one to the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>“It’s the heat that has made it so bad for—her,”
he observed enigmatically.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter’s mouth tightened and he glanced
angrily toward the door. He heard his son coming
down-stairs. William entered, looking pale
and haggard, and Colonel Denbigh rose. The old
man was so tall that he seemed to tower.</p>

<p>“William,” he said grimly, “I came to see you.
Virginia sent me. We wanted Dan to tell you,
but Dan doesn’t wish to interfere. Your wife is
at my house—very ill.”</p>

<p>William turned from white to red. For a moment
he seemed nonplused, then he rallied.</p>

<p>“I have no wife, Colonel Denbigh,” he said
slowly. “Fanchon left me weeks ago. I expect
to sue her for divorce.”</p>

<p>Colonel Denbigh held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please,” he said, “and listen.” He
sat down himself, glancing from one to the other,
and finally fixing his eyes on William’s downcast
face. “I hate to butt into other people’s affairs,”
he said simply. “Mr. Carter, I think you know
I’m not a meddler?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter nodded grimly. He, too, was looking
at William.</p>

<p>“We all respect and love you, colonel,” cried
Mrs. Carter tremulously; “but—you know William’s
had a terrible time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>“I know it, madam. Far be it from me to belittle
it. But the other day Virginia found Fanchon
out at Quantah’s. Do you know the place?”
He glanced again at Mr. Carter. “It’s wretched.
William’s wife was there, ill and penniless. My
granddaughter went in to see her, and while she
was there Fanchon went out of her head and
fainted in Jinny’s arms. I think you all know
Jinny. She paid the poor girl’s bills—”</p>

<p>“I offered her money, I’ve tried to send her
money,” William broke in hoarsely. “I didn’t
know where she was.”</p>

<p>The colonel nodded.</p>

<p>“I understand that. She told Jinny she
wouldn’t take your money. She told her story—in
a way—to Jinny. She admitted that she loved
you still, that she had always loved you. You
were the only good man who had ever loved her,
she said. Then she fainted. Jinny sent for Dr.
Barbour. It happened that your brother Dan was
over there. He came back with Lucas. I was
out, and he and Jinny brought Fanchon to our
house. He had been looking for Fanchon. He had
guessed that she hadn’t any money, and he wanted
to pay Jinny back for the expenses. He’s shared
our watch over Fanchon, but”—the colonel smiled—“he
wouldn’t interfere. That’s what he said.
So Jinny sent me. Fanchon has been out of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
head, and all night, sometimes all day, she’s calling
you, William. Her pride, her poor little hurt
pride, took her away, but now she calls and calls.”</p>

<p>The colonel rose quietly and took up his hat.
“I think that’s all. I came to tell you. She’s
suffered, and she saved Leigh; but if you feel you
can’t forgive her—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter was crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, Johnson, I think we ought to go,” she
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter said nothing, but glanced silently at
William. So did Colonel Denbigh.</p>

<p>“William,” said the latter gravely, “Jinny
said, ‘Tell William that Fanchon loves him as few
women love, and she’s calling him!’ She lies there,
quite out of her head still, William, calling and
calling to her husband.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter got up and put on her hat.</p>

<p>“I’m coming with you, colonel,” she sobbed.
“I’ve felt it was all wrong. We were hard on
her, poor girl!”</p>

<p>“No, mother, I’ll go,” said William. “It’s my
business. I’m going with you, colonel.”</p>

<p>The colonel straightened himself.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he said simply.</p>

<p>He was aware that Mr. Carter, red and out of
breath, was being urged into his coat and hat by
his wife. He was to take them all, then. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
lucky he had brought the wagonette instead of
the old rockaway.</p>

<p>The wagonette was waiting outside under the
shadow of a tree, the horses carefully netted, and
Lucas wearing a brown linen coat and a big straw
hat. Colonel Denbigh helped Mrs. Carter up the
high steps and they started, the colonel and Mr.
Carter on one side and Mrs. Carter and William
on the other.</p>

<p>Facing each other thus, an awkward silence fell,
broken only by the heavy tread of the horses’
hoofs. They were almost half-way out there before
the colonel thought of anything to say.</p>

<p>“The oats came on well this year, Carter,” he
remarked at last, with forced cheerfulness. “Fine
crop!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, whose feet still felt several sizes
too large for his shoes, let his misery loose.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give a cent for the oat-crop,” he
said bluntly. “I’m not a horse.”</p>

<p>The colonel, startled for a moment, exploded
into laughter, but Mrs. Carter was shocked.</p>

<p>“Oh, Johnson!” she gasped, and then, anxious
to propitiate the colonel, she plunged in desperately.
“It’s been such a beautiful year,” she said
anxiously. “I don’t think I ever remember a
season when things held so well. Nothing looks
rusty yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>The colonel rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>“Except old men, madam,” he remarked with a
twinkle.</p>

<p>She laughed tremulously, winking back her
tears.</p>

<p>“I feel like an old woman, colonel.”</p>

<p>He shook his head, but his eyes were not on
her. They had passed on to her son.</p>

<p>William, flushed and silent, sat with his eyes
down. The colonel, sharply aware of the tension
in the air, wondered. Could Jinny make this lummox
see? At the thought of Jinny the old man’s
eyes lighted, and he looked ahead toward his own
gates. They stood open, and he could see the
old ginkgo-tree beside the door, already turning
yellow as gold in the sun. The horses turned placidly,
the wheel grated slightly on the stone curb,
and they were going up the drive to the house.</p>

<p>“She’s in the west room,” said the colonel,
glancing toward two windows where the shutters
were half-closed. “We got a nurse the second
night. I wasn’t willing to have Jinny wear herself
out. She was up with her for twenty-four
hours on a stretch.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter made an inarticulate sound, glancing
at William in a frightened way, but no one
spoke until the wagonette stopped at the door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
Daniel Carter came down the piazza steps to meet
them.</p>

<p>“She’s better,” he said soberly. “Virginia
thinks she knows her.”</p>

<p>His mother clung to his hand as he helped her
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, why didn’t you tell us?” she whispered.</p>

<p>He glanced grimly at William.</p>

<p>“I thought it was no use, mother.”</p>

<p>She knew what he meant, and she, too, glanced
at William. He was following Colonel Denbigh
up the steps, but his face was set and hard.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dan? How is she, really?” his
mother asked anxiously. “I felt so ashamed when
the colonel told us. We’ve been very unkind to
her, Dan.”</p>

<p>He nodded. They were behind the others, but
he saw Virginia on the stairs.</p>

<p>“Fanchon has been delirious and very ill,” he
answered in a low voice; “but Dr. Barbour says
she’ll get well. The Denbighs have been most noble,
most kind to her.”</p>

<p>“You mean Jinny,” his mother murmured.</p>

<p>“I mean both.” His eyes softened. “Virginia
is an angel!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, looking at him suddenly, winked
back her tears. She knew now—he loved Virginia!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
She patted his arm, but she was looking
at the stairs.</p>

<p>Virginia, in a pink morning gown, the short
sleeves falling away from her white arms, came
down, bearing a tray. She saw them at the door,
and she blushed, but she put down the tray before
she spoke.</p>

<p>“Daniel, please take your mother into the drawing-room
and tell her about Fanchon.” She took
a step forward and held out her hand. “William,
I hope you’re coming with me?” she said.</p>

<p>He took her hand, aware that his father and
Colonel Denbigh, his mother and Daniel, were all
watching. His blush was deeper than hers.</p>

<p>“I came because you sent for me, Virginia,”
he replied in a hard, level tone.</p>

<p>Virginia’s hand fell at her side. For a moment
she looked at him in silence; then she turned.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>William followed her up the wide old stairs,
moving slowly, only aware of the humiliation he
felt. After ascending the last flight Virginia stood
before an open door and beckoned. He came to
her side.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“William!”</p>

<p>He started. He knew the voice—it was Fanchon’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>“William!” she called again, and the light,
hurrying voice went on—sometimes in French,
sometimes in English, but always repeating the
cry, “William!”</p>

<p>“It’s like that all day,” said Virginia. “She
calls and calls you. It’s pitiful, William, and it’s
beautiful—she loves you so!”</p>

<p>He raised his dull eyes slowly from the floor to
Fanchon’s face. What he saw there made him
draw a deep breath of pain.</p>

<p>He stepped into the room. The light was dim,
but he saw the face on the pillow and the soft,
dark, wildly disheveled hair. Fanchon lay there,
tossing, moving her hands restlessly, her fawn-like
eyes brilliant and vacant, her small white
face tear-stained, and her lips moving, whether
words came or not.</p>

<p>While her husband stood there, his head bowed,
just inside the door, she began to speak again in
rambling and broken sentences.</p>

<p>“William! I’m not bad—I’ve never been bad—<i>non,
non</i>! You can’t threaten me—I won’t stand
it, I’ll call my husband—William, William!”</p>

<p>She sat up in bed, and tears ran down her
cheeks. She seemed to be looking at Virginia,
who still stood in the door.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do wrong—I loved him. You shan’t
take him away—I love him—William!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>William listened, and it seemed to him as if his
own heart stopped beating. The soft, appealing
voice, and the white, pitiful face! He felt a sudden
sensation of suffocation.</p>

<p>“<i>Guillaume de mon cœur!</i> He’ll come,” cried
Fanchon softly.</p>

<p>William took a quick step forward, hesitated,
and then went across the room. He knelt beside
the bed and caught the trembling, groping little
hands in his and held them.</p>

<p>Virginia turned away.</p>

<p>She went quietly out of the room and shut the
door behind her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Virginia came down-stairs she heard the
pleasant jingle of ice in the drawing-room. Plato
was serving iced tea, there being no occasion in
life, not even a funeral, when refreshments were
not served; but Mr. Carter and her grandfather
were the only tea-drinkers. Mrs. Carter was sitting
in the corner, surreptitiously wiping her
eyes, and Daniel was walking up and down on the
rear piazza. Virginia heard his restless tramp as
she crossed the hall and stood for a moment in the
drawing-room door. They all looked up at her,
and Plato discreetly withdrew, bearing his tray.</p>

<p>“How is she, Jinny?” the colonel asked quietly,
setting aside his slender glass of tea.</p>

<p>“I think she knew him,” Virginia answered simply,
and then, ignoring the two men, she went
over to Mrs. Carter. “You were good to come,”
she said softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Virginia!” Mrs. Carter dabbed at her
eyes, “I feel as if I’d been guilty.” She lowered
her voice and added in a whisper: “What did
William say?”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled, a beautiful light in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>“I think he’s forgiven her already,” she replied
sweetly. “I’ve been with her for hours and hours,
and I’m fond of her. I can’t help it. She’s like
a child, Mrs. Carter, and she loves William. Besides,
she’s suffered terribly, and don’t you think
suffering expiates everything?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter pressed her handkerchief against
her lips. For a moment she was silent, aware of
her husband’s eyes and Colonel Denbigh’s. Involuntarily
they looked at her. She wavered a
little, and then she spoke, faint-heartedly but sincerely.</p>

<p>“Johnson, I think we ought to go up-stairs, too.
We ought to tell William how we feel—at least,
I should. I’m ready to do anything that’s right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter nodded his head slowly.</p>

<p>“I’ve just told the colonel that we’re not really
monsters,” he replied bluntly; “but we’ve had
rather a rough experience, take it all in all.
There’s Leigh, nothing but a boy, and he’s killed
a man. It’s not a nice thing to think about. He
told me one night how he felt. It haunts him.
Besides, I’ve seen William falling down on his
work. The whole racket got on our nerves. I
reckon we were hard on her. William used to call
her a wild fawn. Maybe, if we’d met her from
the first in the right way, she’d have tamed
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>Colonel Denbigh pulled hard at his mustache.</p>

<p>“Give her a little love, Carter, and trust in
the Lord,” he advised gently.</p>

<p>It was Virginia, however, who solved the problem.</p>

<p>“William must take her away,” she said decidedly.
“She’s used to big cities, to life and light
and change, and she couldn’t endure us here. It
will be a long time before she can. If he takes her
away they’ll understand each other, Mrs. Carter,
and then the rest of it will solve itself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter assented to this. It came to her
in the nature of manna from heaven. To mend
William’s marriage and to escape the responsibility
of Fanchon would be almost too good to be
true.</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s just it, Jinny,” she said
weakly. “It’s all wrong for two young people
to start in together with another family. We’re
right set in our ways, too. I think you’re right.
Don’t you, papa?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter nodded again. There was a little
pause, broken only by the distant sound of
Daniel’s march on the piazza.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that boy coming in here to sit down and
drink some tea?” Mr. Carter demanded suddenly
and sharply, addressing space.</p>

<p>“I’ll call him,” said Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>But as she spoke they heard a step on the stairs
and William’s voice.</p>

<p>“Mother, will you come up and see—my wife?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rose, with a gasp, glancing at her
husband. She met assent in his eyes, and she
hurried out into the hall. William stood there,
his face changed and softened, but still very pale.
His eyes met his mother’s, and he held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“She’s come out of her delirium. She knows
me—and she wants to ask your forgiveness,” he
said in a low voice, swallowing a lump in his
throat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter clung to his arm, lifting her face
to his.</p>

<p>“Oh, Willie!” she sobbed, and kissed him.</p>

<p>The colonel and Mr. Carter saw the mother and
son going up-stairs together.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said the colonel with manifest
relief. “I’m mighty glad of it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made no reply, but lifted his glass
of iced tea slowly to his lips and drank it. He
felt choked. He was registering a silent vow that,
whatever happened, Emily shouldn’t paint her
eyelashes!</p>

<p>Virginia, smiling at her grandfather, slipped
quietly out of the room. She stood for a moment
in the wide, cool hall, listening. She could hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
the faint murmur of voices above her, and the
tramp of Daniel’s nervous feet. Outside the door
the warm sunshine seemed to pulsate, and a thousand
little gnats danced in a circle in mid air.
Virginia crossed the hall softly and stood in the
door.</p>

<p>Daniel, very pale and quiet, stopped his marching
up and down. His eyes met hers with a silent
interrogation.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Dan,” she said gently. “William
just called your mother. It’s made up.”</p>

<p>Daniel drew a deep breath, his eyes on her
face. He thought he had never seen her look so
beautiful.</p>

<p>“It’s your doing, Virginia,” he said softly.</p>

<p>She shook her head, coming out and standing
beside him in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“It’s God’s doing, Dan,” she replied gravely.</p>

<p>He said nothing. He was still gazing at her.
She looked so beautiful and so happy that he
wondered if, after all, she cared for William. Then
he reflected that angels must always look beautiful
in acts of love and renunciation.</p>

<p>She turned and smiled at him again.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk down to the end of the garden,”
she said gently. “It’s cool there under the old
mulberry.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly, not because of his lameness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
for he was limping very little to-day, but
because the walk through the old garden-paths
was sweet.</p>

<p>“My roses are still blooming,” remarked Virginia.
“I’m going to set out some more of these
late ones this autumn. How sweet the air is to-day!”</p>

<p>He looked up at the clear sky. Only a few
white clouds floated in the deep, ineffable blue.</p>

<p>“It’s a heavenly day,” he said.</p>

<p>They were silent after that, walking between
the hedgerows, until they came to a grassy slope
that was left to go wild, because Virginia loved
wild flowers. Here, in the spring, were pink anemones
and blood-root, and now there were little
yellow flowers on the green blades of grass.</p>

<p>They sat down together on a fallen tree, which
had been left lying there for a seat. Daniel looked
down at the little yellow stars in the grass.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they pretty things?” he said musingly.
“At first I thought this was only common
turf, but it’s full of yellow stars.”</p>

<p>Virginia, following his eyes, smiled.</p>

<p>“They call that star-grass, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Star-grass?” he repeated thoughtfully, “it’s
a pretty name, Virginia. Do you know why I was
looking at it? Those little stars are everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
like tiny points of flame—and they are all around
your feet, little flames of incense.”</p>

<p>“There’s a legend,” she replied, “that those
little stars were fastened on the blades of grass
so that the humble things of earth, which couldn’t
look so high as heaven, could see the stars in the
grass. Isn’t it a quaint idea?”</p>

<p>Daniel nodded, leaning his chin on the hands
that clasped the top of his walking-stick, and looking
at them, something grim and sad coming into
his face.</p>

<p>“I saw a white-breasted nuthatch yesterday in
that tree,” said Virginia dreamily.</p>

<p>He did not reply, and there was such a long
silence that she turned and looked at him. She
saw how pale he had grown, how the delicate hollows
had fallen in his cheeks, and the shadows under
his eyes. Daniel’s eyes were beautiful, she
thought—like a woman’s in their clear kindness.
Perhaps it was the pain he had borne for so
many years after his hurt.</p>

<p>“Virginia, if you look at me like that I shall
say something,” he cried suddenly. “I can’t bear
it! Turn your eyes away, Virginia.”</p>

<p>She laughed a little tremulously, blushing, too.</p>

<p>“But why, Dan? A cat may look at a king,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>He did not answer for a while. He was digging
little holes in the soft turf with his stick.</p>

<p>“A cripple can’t speak,” he said at last. “A
cripple can’t tell a woman what he feels, even
when that woman is an angel of compassion.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not a cripple, Dan. You’re only
a little lame. It grows less, too, every day.”</p>

<p>“I overheard father once,” Daniel replied bitterly.
“He called me a cripple. ‘No girl wants
a cripple,’ he said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how cruel,” Virginia cried. “And it’s
not true, Dan; it’s not true at all!”</p>

<p>Daniel started, looking around at her, but her
face was averted. He only saw her charming profile
against the beauty of the foliage behind her.
Something in it—something tender and sympathetic—reached
him. He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Virginia, you can’t mean——”</p>

<p>She said nothing, but she lifted her eyes a little
shyly to his face, and this time Daniel could not
resist the look.</p>

<p>“You can’t mean that you’d marry me!” he
cried, and then softly, with infinite tenderness:
“Will you, Virginia?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan,” she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>Her smile seemed to change his whole world
for him, and to fill it with an ineffable tenderness
and light. It was no longer the sweet whistling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
of a robin that he heard, but the music of the
spheres. The very ground was carpeted with stars—with
tiny stars that ran like little flames all
the way to Virginia’s feet, for—like the humble
things of earth—Daniel had found his bit of
heaven there.</p>
